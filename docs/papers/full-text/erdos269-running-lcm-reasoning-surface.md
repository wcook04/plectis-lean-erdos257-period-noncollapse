# The Three-Prime Running LCM: Complete Reasoning Record

</div>

For every pair of distinct primes $`p,q`$ both series of Erdős Problem #269 are transcendental: the original series $`\mathcal R_{p,q}`$, in which a reciprocal of the running least common multiple is taken at every $`\{p,q\}`$-smooth integer, and the de-duplicated series $`\mathcal D_{p,q}`$, in which each distinct running least common multiple contributes once. The hypotheses are that $`p`$ and $`q`$ are prime and distinct, and nothing else. Every instance of the problem with $`|P|=2`$ is therefore settled, at the stronger level of transcendence. Ordering the two pure-power channels gives a Beatty word, both values become explicit polynomials in one Hecke–Mahler boundary sum, and transcendence of that sum is the theorem of Loxton and van der Poorten in the modern form of Bugeaud and Laurent. This is an argument in this paper over a cited external theorem, and no Lean declaration formalises it. Steve Fan posted the same factorisation, reduction and conclusion first, on 26 June 2026, so the priority for the two-prime case is his.

The third prime changes the linear algebra of the problem, and the change is exact. Write $`\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)=1/\operatorname{L}(p^{i}q^{j}r^{k})`$ for the reciprocal running-LCM kernel. At two generators the kernel is an outer product and every two-by-two minor vanishes. At three pairwise distinct generators, for every order $`n`$ there are injective index families $`I,J`$ whose minor $`\det(\operatorname{K}(I(a),J(b),k))_{0\le a,b<n}`$ is nonzero simultaneously in every layer $`k`$, so for no finite $`d`$ do there exist rational-valued $`f_\ell(i)`$ and $`G_\ell(j,k)`$ with $`\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)=\sum_{\ell<d}f_\ell(i)G_\ell(j,k)`$. Both halves of that transition are checked by the Lean kernel at the pinned source revision ee650b32b8b2. A single binary floor carry is the whole difference, and after row and column normalisation that carry matrix admits no better uniform approximation by a finite separated sum than $`(r-1)/(2r)`$, which is half its own jump and is attained by a constant. These statements exclude classes of representations and settle no instance of the problem.

For the repeated $`\{2,3,5\}`$ series the note constructs the literal infinite object. The dyadic shell masses are summable, their normalised tails $`X_a`$ satisfy the integer-coefficient recurrence $`X_{a+1}=b_aX_a-m_a`$ with $`b_a\in\{2,6,10,30\}`$, and $`0<X_a\le(n_a^{2}+8n_a+18)/9`$ where $`n_a`$ is the total height rank at $`2^{a}`$. A rational value with denominator $`2^{u}3^{v}5^{w}B`$, $`\gcd(B,30)=1`$, forces $`BX_a`$ to be a positive integer from the explicit onset $`a_D=u+1+2v+3w`$, bounded by $`K(B,a)=\lfloor B(j_a^{2}+10j_a+27)/9\rfloor`$ at the endpoint jump index $`j_a=n_a-1`$. Let $`\mathsf E(G)`$ be cofinal local-window residue escape against a bound $`G`$. Then $`\mathsf E(G)`$ is equivalent to irrationality of the series for every $`G`$ with $`K\le G`$ and $`G(B,a)=o(2^{a})`$, and the lower half of that band cannot be removed, since $`\mathsf E(0)`$ is vacuous. Nonintegrality of every reduced tail is equivalent to irrationality as well. Both remaining questions are therefore restatements of the problem, and neither of them is a weaker sufficient condition.

The finite evidence is exact and bounded. The pinned integer checker finds an escaping window of length at most $`18`$ for each of $`3{,}869{,}934`$ denominator/start pairs, covering every $`B\le5000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and every start $`100\le\ell\le3000`$; a window-growth law $`8^{h}/15<W_{\ell,h}<15\cdot8^{h}`$ shows that this behaviour cannot persist at bounded length for all starts, so the scan measures a bounded region and leaves the cofinal quantifier untouched. A window-$`128`$ lattice certificate at launch $`a_1=10005`$ excludes an arithmetically described family of rational values, and a continued-fraction certificate excludes every reduced denominator below $`2^{22482}`$. Erdős #269 remains open for every $`|P|\ge3`$.

# The problem, and what is settled

Let $`P`$ be a finite set of primes with $`|P|\ge2`$, and let $`a_1<a_2<\cdots`$ enumerate the positive integers all of whose prime factors lie in $`P`$. Erdős Problem #269 asks whether
``` math
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{1}{[a_1,\ldots,a_n]}
```
is irrational, where $`[a_1,\ldots,a_n]`$ is the least common multiple \[erdosgraham1980, p. 65\]\[erdos1988, p. 106\]. Bloom’s catalogue records the problem as open \[erdosproblems\]. This note settles every instance with $`|P|=2`$, at the level of transcendence, and the unresolved finite cases begin at $`|P|=3`$.

The restriction $`|P|\ge2`$ is necessary. For $`P=\{p\}`$ the enumeration is $`a_n=p^{\,n-1}`$, so $`[a_1,\ldots,a_n]=p^{\,n-1}`$ and the sum is $`p/(p-1)`$. For infinite $`P`$ the sum is always irrational, which Erdős calls a simple exercise \[erdos1988, p. 106\].

Write $`\mathcal R_P`$ for the sum above and $`\mathcal D_P`$ for the de-duplicated sum, in which each distinct value of the running least common multiple contributes its reciprocal once. The two differ because the running value is constant along stretches of the enumeration. In a letter written on 1 January 1973 Erdős recorded that he could prove irrationality of the de-duplicated sum \[erdos1974letter, p. 335\]. He states that assertion for a general finite list of primes and supplies no proof, so the historical record already covers $`\mathcal D_P`$ for every finite $`P`$; the open question addressed by the catalogue is $`\mathcal R_P`$.

**Theorem 1** (two-prime transcendence). *Let $`p`$ and $`q`$ be distinct primes. Then $`\mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}`$ and $`\mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}`$ are transcendental.*

</div>

Section <a href="#long269:sec:two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:two-prime">3</a> proves this. Both values are explicit polynomials in one Hecke–Mahler boundary sum $`A`$, the coefficients are nonzero rationals, and transcendence of $`A`$ is the theorem of Loxton and van der Poorten \[loxtonvdp1977, p. 40, Theorem 8\] in the modern form of Bugeaud and Laurent’s Theorem 1.1 \[bugeaudlaurent2023, p. 61, Theorem 1.1\]. The evidence class is an ordinary proof in this paper over a cited external theorem, and no Lean declaration formalises it.

#### Attribution.

Steve Fan posted the running-LCM identity for every $`|P|`$, the two-channel factorisation, the Hecke–Mahler reduction and the transcendence conclusion in the discussion thread of the problem’s page on 26 June 2026 \[fan2026comment\], with follow-up remarks extending the argument to arbitrary coprime pairs. The priority for the two-prime case is his. The proof below is independent and is given in full because it fixes the $`|P|=2`$ boundary of the problem and because the same boundary sum drives the three-prime discussion. The identity of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a> is cited to him.

#### What the third prime does.

Section <a href="#long269:sec:rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:rank">4</a> isolates the obstruction exactly. After separating row and column factors, the two-prime kernel is an outer product and the three-prime kernel retains one binary floor carry. That carry is enough to produce nonsingular minors of every order, uniformly in the third coordinate, and to make the normalised carry matrix inapproximable by finite separated sums below half its own jump. Sections <a href="#long269:sec:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:blocks">5</a> to <a href="#long269:sec:escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:escape">7</a> take a second route on the literal $`\{2,3,5\}`$ series: dyadic shells give an integer-coefficient tail recurrence, a strict endpoint clears the smooth part of a hypothetical denominator, and the surviving carry is trapped between a quadratic bound and a residue condition. Section <a href="#long269:sec:evidence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:evidence">8</a> reports the finite evidence and its ceiling, and Section <a href="#long269:sec:open" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:open">9</a> states what remains.

Throughout, $`p,q,r`$ are pairwise distinct primes. Call $`n`$ *smooth* when $`n=p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}`$ for some $`i,j,k\ge0`$; this is the [smooth lattice value](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L32). For $`x\ge1`$ write
``` math
\operatorname{L}(x)=\operatorname{lcm}\{\,n\le x:\ n\ \text{smooth}\,\},
 \qquad
 \operatorname{H}(x)=p^{\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor}\,q^{\lfloor\log_q x\rfloor}\,
 r^{\lfloor\log_r x\rfloor},
```
the [running least common multiple](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L54) and the [pure-power height](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L37), where $`\lfloor\log_b x\rfloor`$ is the largest $`e`$ with $`b^{e}\le x`$. Since $`a_1,\ldots,a_n`$ are exactly the smooth numbers up to $`a_n`$, we have $`[a_1,\ldots,a_n]=\operatorname{L}(a_n)`$. The reciprocal of the height at a smooth point is the [lattice kernel](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L41)
``` math
\operatorname{K}(i,j,k)=\frac{1}{\operatorname{H}(p^{i}q^{j}r^{k})} .
```
Here “smooth” always means supported on the fixed prime set, and it is not the varying-bound notion counted by $`\Psi(x,y)`$ in the Dickman–Hildebrand theory \[hildebrand1986, Theorem 1\]; no smooth-number density asymptotic is used below. For $`b\in\{p,q,r\}`$ the set of positive powers of $`b`$ is the *$`b`$-channel*.

The statement of Problem #269 has been formalised before, as a conjecture with an unfilled proof, in the *Formal Conjectures* collection \[formalconjectures269\]. That is a formal statement of the question up to an initial constant: its Nat-indexed series includes the empty-prefix term, so its value is exactly $`1`$ plus the conventional series. Its rational, irrational and infinite-prime assertions all end in `sorry`. Kovač and Tao \[kovactao2024\] treat several irrationality problems of Erdős for series of unit fractions by elementary means; nothing from that work is used here.

# The finite geometry of the running value

The smooth numbers up to $`x`$ are indexed by the exponent triples $`(i,j,k)`$ with $`i\le\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor`$, $`j\le\lfloor\log_q x\rfloor`$, $`k\le\lfloor\log_r x\rfloor`$ and $`p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}\le x`$, the [smooth prefix index set](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L47). Both conditions matter: the coordinate box is strictly larger than the prefix, since a product of three large pure powers can exceed $`x`$ while each factor does not.

<div id="long269:res:lcm" class="theorem">

**Theorem 2** (the running least common multiple). *Let $`p,q,r`$ be pairwise distinct primes and $`x\ge1`$. Then $`\operatorname{L}(x)=\operatorname{H}(x)`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Every smooth $`n\le x`$ has exponents bounded by the corresponding integer logarithms, so $`n\mid\operatorname{H}(x)`$ and hence $`\operatorname{L}(x)\mid\operatorname{H}(x)`$. Conversely the three pure powers $`p^{\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor}`$, $`q^{\lfloor\log_q x\rfloor}`$ and $`r^{\lfloor\log_r x\rfloor}`$ are themselves smooth numbers not exceeding $`x`$, so each divides $`\operatorname{L}(x)`$, and distinct primes have coprime powers, so their product divides $`\operatorname{L}(x)`$ as well. ◻

The unrestricted analogue is classical: iterating the prime-exponent maximum rule gives $`\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,N)=\prod_{t\le N}t^{\lfloor\log_t N\rfloor}`$ over the primes $`t\le N`$ \[apostol1976, Ex. 1.21(a), p. 22\], equivalently $`\log\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,N)=\psi(N)`$ \[apostol1976, §4.2, p. 75\], and Montgomery and Vaughan state the identity directly in Exercise 6.2.7 \[montgomeryvaughan2007, p. 183\]. Fan states the $`P`$-restricted form for every $`|P|`$ \[fan2026comment\]. The pairwise distinctness hypothesis is used exactly once, in the coprimality step.

At $`(p,q,r)=(2,3,5)`$ the first ten values are
``` math
\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}
x&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10\\ \hline
\operatorname{L}(x)&1&2&6&12&60&60&60&120&360&360
\end{array}
```
So $`\operatorname{L}(6)=4\cdot3\cdot5=60`$, which exceeds $`6`$: the running value at a smooth cutoff already contains powers of the other two primes that the cutoff itself does not. That small fact is the mechanism behind Section <a href="#long269:sec:rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:rank">4</a>. Also $`\operatorname{H}(x)\le x^{3}`$, since each of the three factors is a power of its base not exceeding $`x`$; this is the [cubic majorant](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L431), and the exponent is the number of generating primes.

Say that $`x`$ and $`y`$ lie in the same *logarithmic cell* when $`\lfloor\log_b x\rfloor=\lfloor\log_b y\rfloor`$ for each of $`b=p,q,r`$, the [cell relation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L164). By Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a> the running value depends on $`x`$ only through the three integer logarithms, so it is constant on cells and moves only where one logarithm moves.

<div id="long269:res:cell" class="proposition">

**Proposition 3** (constancy and jump ratios). *If $`x,y\ge1`$ lie in the same logarithmic cell then $`\operatorname{L}(x)=\operatorname{L}(y)`$, and the same holds for the kernel at two smooth points of one cell. If $`\lfloor\log_p y\rfloor=\lfloor\log_p x\rfloor+1`$ while the other two logarithms agree, then $`\operatorname{L}(y)=p\,\operatorname{L}(x)`$, and similarly with $`q`$ or $`r`$ in place of $`p`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Both parts are immediate from Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a>: the height depends on $`x`$ only through the three integer logarithms, and advancing one of them multiplies exactly one factor by its base. ◻

Two channels never meet, so at each positive pure power exactly one logarithm advances and the running value is multiplied there by the prime of that channel. Reading those multipliers in increasing order of the pure powers gives the *jump word* of $`\operatorname{L}`$. At $`\{2,3,5\}`$ the pure powers in increasing order are $`2,3,4,5,8,9,16,25,27,32,\ldots`$, so the jump word begins

2,\;3,2,\;5,2,\;3,2,\;5,3,2,\;\ldots

Two finite statements are recorded here because they are the exact shape of the counting used later. Write $`\mathcal B(h_p,h_q,h_r)`$ for the box of exponent triples with $`i\le h_p`$, $`j\le h_q`$, $`k\le h_r`$, the [exponent box](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L369), and $`F(H)`$ for the set of its points whose height equals $`H`$, the [height fibre](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L378).

At $`(2,3,5)`$ on $`\mathcal B(1,1,1)`$ the eight smooth values $`1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30`$ carry heights $`1,2,6,60,60,360,360,10800`$, so two coefficients equal $`2`$ and the identity reads $`18421/10800`$ on both sides. The identity is between two finite sums over a box, so it is not a statement about $`\operatorname{L}`$ at a cutoff. The same module records the one-step map $`\tau(b,d,s)=b(s-d)`$, the [variable-base tail step](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L488), with the rewriting [that names its expanded form](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L491); the orbits analysed in Section <a href="#long269:sec:blocks" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:blocks">5</a> are the actual ones, and no orbit of this abstract map is analysed.

The other case is the same with the first coordinate projected away. Under the sorting hypothesis the two surviving coordinates are the two smallest, so it suffices that $`a\le b\le c`$ with $`a+b+c=j`$ gives $`9(a+1)(b+1)\le(j+3)^{2}`$. From $`a\le b\le c`$ we get $`a+2b\le j`$, so it is enough that $`9(a+1)(b+1)\le(a+2b+3)^{2}`$; writing $`b=a+d`$ with $`d\ge0`$, the difference of the two sides is $`d(3a+4d+3)\ge0`$. ◻

The constant $`9`$ is the square of the number of generating primes, and the last inequality of the proof is an equality when $`h_p=h_q=h_r`$, so no larger constant survives that step.

# One Hecke–Mahler value controls both two-prime sums

Temporarily let $`P=\{p,q\}`$ with $`p<q`$, and write $`L_{p,q}(t)=p^{\lfloor\log_p t\rfloor}q^{\lfloor\log_q t\rfloor}`$, which is the running least common multiple of the $`\{p,q\}`$-smooth numbers up to $`t`$ by the argument of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lcm">2</a> with one coordinate omitted. The de-duplicated sum retains the initial value $`1`$ and one reciprocal for every later distinct running value, so
``` math
\mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}
 =1+\sum_{t\in\{p,p^2,\ldots\}\cup\{q,q^2,\ldots\}}\frac1{L_{p,q}(t)},
 \qquad
 \mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}=\sum_{i,j\ge0}\frac1{L_{p,q}(p^iq^j)} .
```

<div class="proof">

*Proof of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:lead-two-prime" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:lead-two-prime">1</a>.* Set
``` math
\theta=\frac{\log p}{\log q},\qquad x=\frac1p,\qquad y=\frac1q,\qquad
 m_n=\lfloor n\theta\rfloor,\qquad \delta_n=m_{n+1}-m_n .
```
Here $`0<\theta<1`$, and $`\theta`$ is irrational, since a rational value would give $`p^{b}=q^{a}`$ for positive integers $`a,b`$. Consequently $`\delta_n\in\{0,1\}`$. Put
``` math
A=\sum_{n\ge0}x^ny^{m_n},
 \qquad
 B_\ast=\sum_{n\ge0}\delta_nx^ny^{m_n+1} .
```
The initial value and the $`p`$-channel contribute $`A`$, since $`L_{p,q}(p^n)=p^nq^{m_n}`$. A power of $`q`$ lies strictly between $`p^n`$ and $`p^{n+1}`$ exactly when $`\delta_n=1`$, it is then $`q^{m_n+1}`$, and its post-jump reciprocal is $`x^ny^{m_n+1}`$; so the $`q`$-channel contributes $`B_\ast`$ and $`\mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}=A+B_\ast`$. All these series converge absolutely.

Since $`y^{m_{n+1}}-y^{m_n}=\delta_ny^{m_n}(y-1)`$, an index shift gives $`A-1-xA=x(y-1)B_\ast/y`$, so $`B_\ast=\bigl((p-1)A-p\bigr)/(1-q)`$ and
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:two-prime-affine}
 \mathcal D_{\{p,q\}}=\frac{(q-p)A+p}{q-1} .
\end{equation}
```
At a smooth point, $`\log_p(p^iq^j)=i+j/\theta`$ and $`\log_q(p^iq^j)=j+i\theta`$, so $`L_{p,q}(p^iq^j)=p^{\,i+\lfloor j/\theta\rfloor}q^{\,j+m_i}`$ and absolute convergence permits the factorisation
``` math
\mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}=AC,\qquad C=\sum_{j\ge0}y^jx^{\lfloor j/\theta\rfloor}.
```
For $`j\ge1`$ put $`n=\lfloor j/\theta\rfloor`$. Then $`n>j/\theta-1`$ gives $`n\theta>j-\theta>j-1`$, and $`n+1>j/\theta`$ gives $`(n+1)\theta>j`$, while $`n\theta\le j`$ and $`(n+1)\theta<j+\theta<j+1`$; hence $`m_n=j-1`$, $`m_{n+1}=j`$ and $`\delta_n=1`$. Conversely every $`n`$ with $`\delta_n=1`$ arises from the unique $`j=m_{n+1}`$. Therefore $`C=1+B_\ast`$ and
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic}
 \mathcal R_{\{p,q\}}
 =\frac{(p+q-1)A-(p-1)A^{2}}{q-1} .
\end{equation}
```

It remains to prove that $`A`$ is transcendental. For the Hecke–Mahler series
``` math
F_\theta(x,y)=\sum_{n\ge1}\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n\theta\rfloor}x^ny^k
```
a finite geometric sum gives $`\bigl((1-y)/y\bigr)F_\theta(x,y)=x/(1-x)-(A-1)`$, that is
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary}
 A=\frac1{1-x}-\frac{1-y}{y}F_\theta(x,y).
\end{equation}
```
Bugeaud and Laurent’s Theorem 1.1 states, in particular, that $`F_\theta(\beta,\alpha)`$ is transcendental when $`\theta\in(0,1)`$ is irrational, $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ are nonzero algebraic numbers, $`|\beta|<1`$ and $`|\beta\alpha^\theta|<1`$ \[bugeaudlaurent2023, p. 61, Theorem 1.1\]; the $`\rho=0`$ case used here goes back to Loxton and van der Poorten \[loxtonvdp1977, p. 40, Theorem 8\]. Take $`(\beta,\alpha)=(x,y)`$: then $`|\beta|=1/p<1`$ and
``` math
|xy^{\theta}|=\frac1p\left(\frac1q\right)^{\log p/\log q}=\frac1{p^{2}}<1 .
```
So $`F_\theta(x,y)`$ is transcendental, and <a href="#long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary">[long269:eq:hecke-mahler-boundary]</a> makes $`A`$ transcendental. The coefficient of $`A`$ in <a href="#long269:eq:two-prime-affine" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:two-prime-affine">[long269:eq:two-prime-affine]</a> is $`(q-p)/(q-1)\ne0`$ and the coefficient of $`A^{2}`$ in <a href="#long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic">[long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic]</a> is $`-(p-1)/(q-1)\ne0`$, both rational. If either value were algebraic, its identity would exhibit $`A`$ as a root of a nonzero polynomial over the algebraic numbers. ◻

A product of two transcendental numbers need not be transcendental, so the factorisation $`\mathcal R=AC`$ alone proves nothing; the quadratic identity <a href="#long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic">[long269:eq:two-prime-quadratic]</a> in the single value $`A`$ is what settles the repeated sum. A third prime replaces the single Beatty boundary by a genuinely two-dimensional ordering problem, and the next section makes that failure exact.

One might hope to write the kernel as $`f(i)g(j)h(k)`$ and reduce the problem to one-dimensional criteria. At two generators that hope is exactly correct, and at three it fails at every finite order.

Every term except the last floor depends on $`i`$ and $`k`$ alone or on $`j`$ and $`k`$ alone, so with positive rational $`R_i(k)`$ and $`C_j(k)`$,

The remaining matrix is independent of $`k`$, and $`x_i+y_j\in[0,2)`$, so its entries are $`1`$ and $`t`$.

Each of $`\alpha`$ and $`\beta`$ is irrational, since a rational value would give an equality of positive powers of distinct primes, so each fractional-part orbit is dense in $`(0,1)`$ and each is injective. Choose indices with $`0<x_{I(0)}<\cdots<x_{I(n-1)}<1`$, then $`y_{J(0)}`$ in $`(1-x_{I(0)},1)`$ and, for $`b>0`$, $`y_{J(b)}`$ in $`(1-x_{I(b)},1-x_{I(b-1)})`$. These intervals are disjoint, so both index maps are injective, and $`x_{I(a)}+y_{J(b)}\ge1`$ exactly when $`b\le a`$. The remaining matrix is therefore

Fan recorded the qualitative obstruction for $`|P|\ge3`$ in his comment of 26 June 2026 \[fan2026comment\], observing that the two-prime argument does not seem to generalise immediately.

Theorem <a href="#long269:res:infinite-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:infinite-rank">10</a> excludes exact separations of the displayed finite-sum form; it is not an independence, irrationality or transcendence statement, and it settles no instance of Erdős #269.

## A sharp uniform obstruction for the normalised carry matrix

The determinant argument is exact and therefore fragile: an arbitrarily small perturbation of the kernel can destroy an exact vanishing. The next theorem replaces exactness by a uniform distance, and the constant it produces is sharp. It concerns the normalised carry matrix
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:carry-matrix}
 C(i,j)=t^{\lfloor x_i+y_j\rfloor},
 \qquad
 x_i=\{i\log_r p\},\quad y_j=\{j\log_r q\},\quad t=r^{-1},
\end{equation}
```
which is the factor left in <a href="#long269:eq:carry-factorisation" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:carry-factorisation">[long269:eq:carry-factorisation]</a> after the row and column factors are divided out. Say that a real matrix $`A`$ on $`\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}`$ has *finite separated rank* when all of its columns lie in one finite-dimensional space of real sequences, equivalently when $`A(i,j)=\sum_{\ell<d}f_\ell(i)g_\ell(j)`$ for some finite $`d`$ and some sequences $`f_\ell,g_\ell`$, with no continuity or boundedness assumed.

<div id="long269:res:uniform-rank" class="theorem">

**Theorem 11** (sharp uniform separated approximation). *Let $`p,q,r`$ be pairwise distinct primes and let $`C`$ be as in <a href="#long269:eq:carry-matrix" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:carry-matrix">[long269:eq:carry-matrix]</a>. Then
``` math
\inf_{A}\ \sup_{i,j\ge0}\ |C(i,j)-A(i,j)|=\frac{1-t}{2}=\frac{r-1}{2r},
```
the infimum being over all matrices $`A`$ of finite separated rank, and it is attained by the constant matrix of value $`(1+t)/2`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Every entry of $`C`$ lies in $`\{1,t\}`$, and $`C(i,j)=t`$ exactly when $`x_i+y_j\ge1`$. Fix $`j\ne k`$. The numbers $`y_j`$ are pairwise distinct, since $`\log_r q`$ is irrational, so we may assume $`y_j<y_k`$, and then $`0\le1-y_k<1-y_j\le1`$. Density of the orbit $`(x_i)`$ in $`(0,1)`$ supplies an index $`i`$ with $`1-y_k<x_i<1-y_j`$, and at that row the two columns carry the entries $`t`$ and $`1`$. Hence any two distinct columns of $`C`$ are at sup-distance exactly $`1-t`$.

Let $`A`$ have finite separated rank and put $`\varepsilon=\sup_{i,j}|C(i,j)-A(i,j)|`$. Suppose $`\varepsilon<(1-t)/2`$. Each column $`A_j`$ then satisfies $`\|A_j\|_\infty\le1+\varepsilon`$, so all columns of $`A`$ lie in $`W=V\cap\ell^{\infty}`$, where $`V`$ is the finite-dimensional space containing the columns of $`A`$; the space $`W`$ is a subspace of $`V`$, hence finite-dimensional, and $`\|\cdot\|_\infty`$ is a genuine norm on it. By the triangle inequality, distinct columns satisfy
``` math
\|A_j-A_k\|_\infty\ \ge\ \|C_j-C_k\|_\infty-2\varepsilon
 \ =\ 1-t-2\varepsilon\ >\ 0 .
```
The compactness input is the standard fact that closed bounded subsets of a finite-dimensional real normed space are compact. The use of $`W=V\cap\ell^\infty`$ is essential: the individual separated row factors need not be bounded. The columns $`A_j`$, $`j\ge0`$, are therefore infinitely many points of $`W`$, all of norm at most $`1+\varepsilon`$ and pairwise separated by a fixed positive distance. A bounded subset of a finite-dimensional normed space is totally bounded, so it contains no infinite uniformly separated family. This contradiction gives $`\varepsilon\ge(1-t)/2`$ for every $`A`$ of finite separated rank.

For sharpness take $`A(i,j)=(1+t)/2`$, which has separated rank one; every entry of $`C`$ is at distance exactly $`(1-t)/2`$ from it. ◻

</div>

The compactness step is standard, and the statement is recorded here for this kernel without a claim of technique. Three qualifications fix its reach. It is a statement about the normalised carry matrix <a href="#long269:eq:carry-matrix" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:carry-matrix">[long269:eq:carry-matrix]</a>: the original kernel carries positive row and column factors that decay, so the conclusion transfers to a weighted uniform norm relative to those factors and not to the unweighted sup norm of $`\operatorname{K}`$. It bounds approximation of the whole infinite matrix, and on any finite range a separated approximant of small rank exists. And it says nothing about approximating the scalar sum, so it yields no irrationality conclusion. What it does add to Theorem <a href="#long269:res:infinite-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:infinite-rank">10</a> is robustness: no finite separated model of the carry, however chosen, gets uniformly closer than half a carry jump. The threshold is exact in both directions, since rank one attains it.

# Dyadic blocks and the literal infinite tail

For the rest of the note set $`P=\{2,3,5\}`$ and $`S=\mathcal R_P`$, and write $`\operatorname{H}_a=\operatorname{H}(2^{a})`$ and $`h_a=\operatorname{H}_a/2`$, so that $`h_0=1/2`$ while $`h_a`$ is a positive integer for $`a\ge1`$. Define the dyadic shell mass, its tail and its normalisation by
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long269:eq:actual-tail}
 s_a=\sum_{\substack{i,j,k\ge0\\ 2^{a}\le2^{i}3^{j}5^{k}<2^{a+1}}}
       \frac1{\operatorname{H}(2^{i}3^{j}5^{k})},

 U_a=\sum_{j\ge a}s_j,

Compress the jump word of Section <a href="#long269:sec:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:lcm">2</a> into the blocks cut out by consecutive powers of two: block $`a`$ starts just after $`2^{a}`$, contains every pure $`3`$- or $`5`$-power strictly between $`2^{a}`$ and $`2^{a+1}`$, and ends with the jump at $`2^{a+1}`$. A channel cannot occur twice inside one block, because two powers of the same base $`b\ge2`$ inside an interval of ratio $`2\le b`$ must coincide; this is the [checked internal-power uniqueness lemma](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L669) for the [internal-power predicate](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreePrimeRunningLcm.lean#L663).

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Every exponent of $`3`$ or $`5`$ in the $`a`$th shell is at most $`a`$, and for each such pair Lemma <a href="#long269:res:short" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:short">6</a> leaves at most one exponent of $`2`$ placing the point in $`[2^{a},2^{a+1})`$. Each height is at least $`2^{a}`$ and the shell contains $`2^{a}`$, so $`0<s_a\le(a+1)^{2}2^{-a}`$. The majorant is summable, which justifies every tail splitting below, and unique prime factorisation identifies $`\sum_a s_a`$ with the original repeated series.

Write the internal jumps as $`t_\ell=p_\ell^{e_\ell}`$, $`1\le\ell\le v`$, and set $`t_0=2^{a}`$, $`t_{v+1}=2^{a+1}`$. Let $`N(t)`$ count smooth positive integers strictly below $`t`$ and put $`n_\ell=N(t_\ell)`$. On $`[t_\ell,t_{\ell+1})`$ the height is $`\operatorname{H}_a\prod_{u\le\ell}p_u`$, and the terminal jump has factor two, so
``` math
h_{a+1}s_a
 =\sum_{\ell=0}^{v}(n_{\ell+1}-n_\ell)\prod_{u>\ell}p_u
 =n_{v+1}-n_0+\sum_{\ell=1}^{v}(p_\ell-1)
        \Bigl(\prod_{u>\ell}p_u\Bigr)(n_\ell-n_0),
```
the second equality being finite summation by parts. Counting by the exponent of $`p`$ gives $`N(p^{e})=C_p(e)`$, so the right-hand side is exactly <a href="#long269:eq:actual-digit" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-digit">[long269:eq:actual-digit]</a>; at $`a=0`$ the shell is the single point $`1`$, giving $`m_0=1`$. Positivity follows from $`s_a>0`$. Splitting $`U_a=s_a+U_{a+1}`$ and multiplying by $`h_a`$ gives the recurrence, and $`b_a\cdots b_j=\operatorname{H}_{j+1}/\operatorname{H}_a`$ with $`m_j=h_{j+1}s_j`$ gives $`m_j/(b_a\cdots b_j)=h_as_j`$, whose summation is the last identity. ◻

**Theorem 15** (quadratic bound for the actual tail). *For every $`a\ge0`$, $`0<X_a\le Q(n_a)`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Partition the smooth integers $`x\ge2^{a}`$ by their height vector $`(A,B,C)=(\lfloor\log_2x\rfloor,\lfloor\log_3x\rfloor,\lfloor\log_5x\rfloor)`$. The cell of a vector is the interval $`[\lambda,\eta)`$ with $`\lambda=\max(2^{A},3^{B},5^{C})`$ and $`\eta=\min(2^{A+1},3^{B+1},5^{C+1})`$, so $`\eta\le2^{A+1}\le2\lambda`$ and, by Lemma <a href="#long269:res:short" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:short">6</a>, fixing the exponents of $`3`$ and $`5`$ leaves at most one exponent of $`2`$. Since $`A\ge B\ge C`$, the cell contains at most
``` math
(B+1)(C+1)\le\frac{(A+B+C+3)^{2}}{9}
```
smooth points: writing $`u=B+1\ge v=C+1`$ and using $`A+1\ge u`$, the difference $`(2u+v)^{2}-9uv=(u-v)(4u-v)`$ is nonnegative. Unique factorisation identifies these exponent triples with distinct smooth integers.

As the cutoff increases all three height exponents are nondecreasing, so two nonempty cells with the same exponent sum are the same cell, and there is at most one nonempty cell of each rank. Every cell above $`2^{a}`$ has rank at least $`n_a`$, and a cell of rank $`n_a+k`$ has height at least $`\operatorname{H}_a2^{k}`$, since each of the $`k`$ extra prime factors is at least $`2`$. Nonnegative summation over ranks, allowing empty ones, gives
``` math
X_a\le\frac1{18}\sum_{k\ge0}\frac{(n_a+k+3)^{2}}{2^{k}}
      =\frac{n_a^{2}+8n_a+18}{9},

the evaluation using the geometric moments $`\sum2^{-k}=2`$, $`\sum k2^{-k}=2`$ and $`\sum k^{2}2^{-k}=6`$. Positivity follows from the shell at $`2^{a}`$. ◻

</div>

The rank here is the sum of the three fixed height exponents, not a varying-smoothness density parameter. The estimate uses only unique factorisation, the short-cell counting bound and geometric moments; it does not invoke a Dickman–Hildebrand asymptotic or a Hecke–Mahler theorem.

This is the analytic content of the section: each additional height rank costs a geometric factor while its multiplicity grows only quadratically. The finite projection and the sorted quadratic inequality are the checked ingredients of Proposition <a href="#long269:res:drop" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:drop">7</a>; grouping the actual infinite tail by height cells and summing the majorant is the argument above.

The bound is used at the endpoint of a window, where the natural index is the positive prime-power jump count strictly below the cutoff. Put

the equality holding because the powers of $`2`$ below $`2^{a}`$ number $`a-1`$ while the powers of $`3`$ and of $`5`$ below $`2^{a}`$ number $`\lfloor\log_3 2^{a}\rfloor`$ and $`\lfloor\log_5 2^{a}\rfloor`$. Substituting $`n_a=j_a+1`$ into $`Q`$ gives the integer bound used throughout the rest of the note:

Otherwise $`b\ge1`$, and every integer $`x<2^{b}`$ has $`2`$-height exponent at most $`b-1`$ while its other height exponents are at most those at $`2^{b}`$, so $`\operatorname{H}(x)\mid\operatorname{H}_b/2=h_b`$ and every term of the finite window clears at $`h_b`$. Writing $`v_a=h_a\sum_{u<a}s_u\in\mathbb{N}`$ gives $`DX_a=h_aN-Dv_a\in\mathbb{Z}`$. Among $`D+1`$ of these integers two share a residue modulo $`D`$, and the corresponding states differ by an integer. ◻

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The identity is the recurrence solved for $`X_a`$, and positivity holds because every shell contains its dyadic left endpoint. Integer coefficients give upward closure. For the last assertion, the difference of the two orbits is multiplied by $`b_n\ge2`$ at each step while the common window bounds its absolute value at time $`A+k`$ by $`w(A+k)`$, so $`2^{k}|y_A-X_A|\le w(A+k)`$ and the stated decay forces equality. ◻

Apply <a href="#long269:eq:actual-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-escape">[long269:eq:actual-escape]</a> with $`a_0=a_D`$ to obtain a window $`(\ell,h)`$ with $`\ell\ge a_D`$. By <a href="#long269:eq:window-identity" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:window-identity">[long269:eq:window-identity]</a>, $`z_{\ell+h}\equiv-BF_{\ell,h}`$ modulo $`W_{\ell,h}`$, while $`0<z_{\ell+h}\le G(B,\ell+h)<\operatorname{lpr}_{W_{\ell,h}}(-BF_{\ell,h})`$. Proposition <a href="#long269:res:consumer" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:consumer">19</a> is the contradiction, so $`S`$ is irrational.

Conversely suppose $`S\notin\mathbb{Q}`$, and fix $`B\ge1`$ coprime to $`30`$ and $`a_0\ge1`$. Set $`\ell=a_0`$. In $`X_\ell=h_\ell\bigl(S-\sum_{a<\ell}s_a\bigr)`$ the finite prefix is rational and $`h_\ell`$ is a positive rational, so $`BX_\ell`$ is irrational and its distance $`\delta`$ from $`\mathbb{Z}`$ is positive. Suppose no length $`h`$ escaped, so that $`r_h=\operatorname{lpr}_{W_{\ell,h}}(-BF_{\ell,h})\le G(B,\ell+h)`$ for every $`h\ge1`$. Then $`k_h=(BF_{\ell,h}+r_h)/W_{\ell,h}`$ is an integer, and multiplying <a href="#long269:eq:window-identity" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:window-identity">[long269:eq:window-identity]</a> by $`B`$ gives
``` math
BX_\ell-k_h=\frac{BX_{\ell+h}-r_h}{W_{\ell,h}} .
```
Both $`BX_{\ell+h}`$ and $`r_h`$ are positive, the first at most $`BQ(n_{\ell+h})`$ by Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-tail-bound" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-tail-bound">15</a> and the second at most $`G(B,\ell+h)`$, so the numerator has absolute value at most $`\max\bigl(BQ(n_{\ell+h}),G(B,\ell+h)\bigr)`$. Each $`b_a\ge2`$ gives $`W_{\ell,h}\ge2^{h}`$, so
``` math
0<\delta\le|BX_\ell-k_h|
 \le\frac{\max\bigl(BQ(n_{\ell+h}),\,G(B,\ell+h)\bigr)}{2^{h}}
 =2^{\ell}\cdot
 \frac{\max\bigl(BQ(n_{\ell+h}),\,G(B,\ell+h)\bigr)}{2^{\ell+h}}

For the two named bounds, $`K\le K_0`$ by Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-cancellation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-cancellation">17</a>, both are quadratic in $`a`$ for fixed $`B`$, and $`K\le K`$ trivially.

The converse direction is checked in Lean at a strictly greater generality than the fixed bound: irrationality implies escape against any short bound that the window growth eventually beats, [checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CofinalWindowEscapeEquivalence.lean#L327), and in particular against every bound dominated by $`c(B)(n+1)^{2}`$, [checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CofinalWindowEscapeEquivalence.lean#L355).

The two directions combine into the equivalence [checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CofinalWindowEscapeEquivalence.lean#L392) for the shifted tail and [checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CofinalWindowEscapeEquivalence.lean#L398) for the series value itself. The Lean equivalence is stated at $`K_0`$; the band of Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint">20</a> is the paper statement.

Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint">20</a> settles a question that a reader is entitled to ask about the criterion. Sharpening the bound below $`K`$ does not weaken the producer, since escape against a bound that fails to dominate the actual carries proves nothing; the zero bound is the extreme case. Enlarging the bound up to any subexponential function does not weaken it either. The producer is therefore a restatement of Erdős #269 for $`P=\{2,3,5\}`$ throughout the band, and work on it is work on the target. Equivalence preserves truth and settles nothing about difficulty, so the reformulation may still be the easier representation to attack; what it does not admit is a cheaper bound.

Two exact countermodels rule out further shortcuts. For $`(W,F,B)=(6,4,1)`$ we have $`\operatorname{lpr}_6(-4)=2`$, so the canonical residue need not be coprime to the accumulated base. For $`(W,F,B)=(60,47,37)`$ we have $`\operatorname{lpr}_{60}(-37\cdot47)=1`$, so a fixed window has no denominator-independent lower bound on that residue. The window may therefore depend genuinely on $`B`$.

The crude estimate $`W_{\ell,h}\ge2^{h}`$ is all the equivalence needs. The actual height formula gives more, and the extra information sets the scale of any finite search.

Each floor difference differs from $`h\theta_p`$ by less than one, and $`3^{\theta_3}=5^{\theta_5}=2`$, so the $`3`$-factor lies strictly between $`2^{h}/3`$ and $`3\cdot2^{h}`$ and the $`5`$-factor strictly between $`2^{h}/5`$ and $`5\cdot2^{h}`$. Multiplying the three ranges gives the bounds. ◻

**Corollary 22** (no bounded-length escape at all starts). *Fix $`B\ge1`$ coprime to $`30`$ and $`H\ge1`$. Only finitely many starts $`\ell`$ admit an escaping window of length at most $`H`$ against the bound $`K`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* A least positive residue never exceeds its modulus, so escape at $`(\ell,h)`$ requires $`K(B,\ell+h)<W_{\ell,h}<15\cdot8^{h}\le15\cdot8^{H}`$. On the other hand $`j_a\ge a-1`$, since the powers $`2,\ldots,2^{a-1}`$ already lie below $`2^{a}`$, so $`K(B,\ell+h)\ge\lfloor B((\ell-1)^{2}+10(\ell-1)+27)/9\rfloor`$, which tends to infinity with $`\ell`$. ◻

Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">22</a> is the exact reason a finite scan cannot approach the cofinal quantifier by widening its denominator range alone. Rearranging its inequality, an escaping window at start $`\ell`$ and endpoint $`a=\ell+h`$ must satisfy
``` math
3h>\log_2K(B,a)-\log_215,
```
so the necessary search depth grows like $`\bigl(\log_2B+2\log_2\ell\bigr)/3`$. This is a lower bound on the length that can possibly work, and it is not an upper bound on the first length that does. Producing the latter is exactly the open problem, and by Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint">20</a> it needs effective control of $`\operatorname{dist}(BX_\ell,\mathbb{Z})`$: counting window growth is easy, and keeping a scaled tail away from the integers is the arithmetic content.

*Status.* The problem treated here is open, and this note does not close it. Every statement below marked as checked is a proposition that the pinned Lean kernel accepts from the sources this note links to, with no `sorry`, no added axiom, and no unchecked evaluation. That is a claim about the formal statement, not about its mathematical interest, its novelty, or the original problem. The unresolved obligations are named exactly, in their own section, and none of the finite computations, reductions, or no-go results here removes one of them.

*Companion system context.* The [claim and trust boundary](../../../claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.pdf#nameddest=systems-trust), [cold-clone route to proof authority](../../../cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf#nameddest=cold-clone-authority), and [public contribution protocol](../../../open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf#nameddest=strategy-protocol) are described in sibling papers. Those descriptions do not change the mathematical status of this note.

# The finite evidence

Three finite computations bear on the problem. Each is exact integer or certified-enclosure arithmetic, none is a Lean theorem, and none settles an instance.

<a id="the-dyadic-window-scan"></a>

## The dyadic-window scan

A *certificate* is a finite tuple of integers recording one instance of the inequality in <a href="#long269:eq:actual-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-escape">[long269:eq:actual-escape]</a>, so that a reader can recheck it in a line. The integer-only [dyadic-window checker](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/tree/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/scripts/check_erdos269_dyadic_windows.py) constructs the ordered pure-power jumps, the block bases and the block digits from exact multiplicity counts, and reproduces the following, with columns the denominator $`B`$, the start $`\ell`$, the length $`h`$, the endpoint jump index $`j_{\ell+h}`$, the window base, the forcing, the residue $`R=\operatorname{lpr}_{W}(-BF)`$ and the bound $`K`$ of <a href="#long269:eq:actual-bound" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-bound">[long269:eq:actual-bound]</a>.
``` math
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|r|r|r|r}
B&\ell&h&j_{\ell+h}&W&F&R&K\\ \hline
1&1&2&4&60&47&13&9\\
7&1&3&5&360&289&137&95\\
16&1&4&7&10800&8735&640&352
\end{array}
```
The first row reads as follows. The window starts at $`\ell=1`$ and has length $`2`$, so $`W=b_1b_2=6\cdot10=60`$; the accumulated forcing is $`F=47`$; and $`\operatorname{lpr}_{60}(-47)=13`$, since $`-47+60=13`$, which exceeds $`K(1,3)=\lfloor(16+40+27)/9\rfloor=9`$. The third row lies outside the domain of <a href="#long269:eq:actual-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long269:eq:actual-escape">[long269:eq:actual-escape]</a>, since $`\gcd(16,30)=2`$, and is displayed to illustrate the window arithmetic at greater depth.

A fresh scan over every $`B\le5000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and every $`100\le\ell\le3000`$ tested $`3{,}869{,}934`$ pairs and found an escaping window in every case, of length at most $`18`$ with search depth permitted to $`24`$. The distribution of first successful lengths concentrates at $`10`$ to $`12`$, which is where Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">22</a> predicts the shortest possible window to lie over this range. The computation uses integers only and is reproducible from the pinned checker with `--max-denominator 5000 --start-min 100 --start-max 3000 --max-length 24 --assert-packet`. Neither the scan nor the three displayed certificates proves escape for unbounded $`B`$ or for cofinally many starts, and by Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">22</a> no scan at bounded length can.

</div>

The exponent triple $`(10005,6312,4308)`$ is the height exponent triple of $`\operatorname{H}(2^{10005})`$, so the certificate normalises by the full height at its launch. Lemma <a href="#long269:res:all-scale-lattice" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:all-scale-lattice">16</a> normalises by the half height $`h_{10005}`$; the certificate’s smooth family is accordingly the larger one. The recorded quantities are the window product with $`\log_2P=386.40993\ldots`$, the exclusion index $`J=1`$ certified from a reduced basis lying inside the per-start budget, an enclosure of width $`9.674\times10^{-227}`$, and a maximum ratio $`\max X/W=0.185997`$. This is a computational certificate and nothing else: no Lean declaration carries any part of it, so it rests on the correctness of the exact integer engine that produced it, and the certificate record is held in the author’s formal-mathematics archive, outside the public source of this release.

<div id="long269:res:cf-exclusion" class="theorem">

**Theorem 24** (continued-fraction exclusion, computational certificate). *The normalised tail $`X_1`$ has $`13{,}109`$ certified partial quotients, so it is not rational with denominator at most $`2^{22482}`$, about $`10^{6768}`$.*

</div>

The certification is by common prefix of the continued fractions of the two endpoints of an interval provably containing $`X_1`$, so no approximation heuristic enters, and the truncation was independently checked to agree with the direct smooth-number sum as an exact rational. The recorded statistics are a largest denominator of $`22{,}483`$ bits, a largest partial quotient of $`129{,}114`$, a mean partial quotient of $`23.4133`$, observed Gauss–Kuzmin frequencies $`0.4208`$, $`0.1665`$, $`0.0917`$, $`0.0575`$, $`0.0391`$ against the predicted $`0.4150`$, $`0.1699`$, $`0.0931`$, $`0.0589`$, $`0.0406`$, and a Lévy constant of $`1.18869`$ against $`\pi^{2}/(12\log2)=1.18657`$. No Liouville behaviour and no algebraic or self-similar continued-fraction structure appears below that height.

Each exclusion is finite and neither contains the other: one is indexed by a lattice at a fixed launch and fixed smooth part, the other by continued-fraction depth at $`a=1`$. Every larger denominator survives both, so neither settles an instance of the problem.

Individual irrationality of $`\theta_3`$ and $`\theta_5`$ is what Theorem <a href="#long269:res:infinite-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:infinite-rank">10</a> uses, and it is weaker than the joint equidistribution or the rational independence of $`1,\theta_3,\theta_5`$ that a two-dimensional value theorem may need; the stronger hypothesis is not assumed anywhere above. The finite-observer formalisation isolates the precise faithfulness requirement: equality in a finite observer must imply equality after symbolic realisation, and a genuine finite-dimensional factorisation forces the realised symbolic span to be finite-dimensional ([residue-coboundary form](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L109), [symbolic realisation](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L293), [checked](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L334)), with the carry residue and residue digit confined to their declared intervals ([carry interval](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L150), [digit interval](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/WeightedPhaseCarry.lean#L157)). No theorem here proves that the literal realised span is infinite.

<a id="structural-constraints-already-in-place"></a>

## Structural constraints already in place

The radix alphabet extends without difficulty. For ordered primes $`p_1<\cdots<p_s`$ an interval $`(p_1^{a},p_1^{a+1})`$ contains at most one power from each other channel, because consecutive $`p_i`$-powers have ratio $`p_i>p_1`$, so its block radix belongs to the $`2^{s-1}`$-letter alphabet $`\{p_1\prod_{i=2}^{s}p_i^{\varepsilon_i}:\varepsilon_i\in\{0,1\}\}`$. The quantitative questions are the interesting ones: effective recurrence or discrepancy for the actual four-letter $`\{2,6,10,30\}`$ word, an asymptotic with an error term for the restricted two-dimensional shell counts that generate $`m_a`$, or the exact separated rank of the literal kernel under a specified family of shifts.

Three-channel rigidity and carry-lift extinction already exclude one proposed argument in four exact steps. Under channel surjectivity, ordinary block nullity is equivalent to the perturbation being a coboundary of a channel potential ([potential classifier](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/ThreeChannelBlockRigidity.lean#L59)). Zero perturbations on genuine $`2\to3`$ and $`2\to5`$ transitions then identify all three potential values and force the perturbation to vanish at every index. For an integral lift, that vanishing makes a nonzero initial error grow by the exact product of the successive bases, and bases at least two make its absolute value at least $`2^{N}`$, contradicting even a single index-$`N`$ bound strictly below $`2^{N}`$ ([one-index extinction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CarryLiftExtinction.lean#L178)); consequently no uniform bound on the lift error can hold either ([uniform extinction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CarryLiftExtinction.lean#L238)). A separate four-state calculation reaches the obstruction earlier: four real states in $`(0,1)`$ with unit-accuracy integral lifts and the two anchor equalities force the first complete $`2`$-block sum to be $`1`$, so that block cannot be null ([first-block sum](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CarryLiftExtinction.lean#L289), [four-state obstruction](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/CarryLiftExtinction.lean#L308)).

These lift conclusions are conditional. The paper constructs the actual orbit and its bounded integral carry under rationality, and it does not construct a faithful lift with the two anchors or the block nullity those auxiliary statements require. The actual carry supplies a weighted block defect instead, so any successful argument along that line must use the weighted identity or construct a different faithful lift.

A single conditional single-channel criterion is also on record. For the pure $`2`$-channel sum the Cantor states lie in an explicit open interval ([confinement](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/PurePowerIrrationality.lean#L61)), consecutive states are separated ([gap bound](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/PurePowerIrrationality.lean#L74)), a small nonzero linear form forces irrationality ([criterion](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/PurePowerIrrationality.lean#L94)), and clearing together with small gaps assembles to irrationality ([assembly](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/ee650b32b8b2cb98b94e5500df5370d85f7403b8/ErdosProblems/Erdos269/PurePowerIrrationality.lean#L156)). The clearing and small-gap hypotheses are not discharged for any concrete series, so no irrationality statement follows from them here.

<a id="where-the-problem-stands"></a>

## Where the problem stands

Erdős #269 is settled for $`|P|=2`$, at the level of transcendence, and open for every $`|P|\ge3`$. For $`P=\{2,3,5\}`$ the reduction is complete on the arithmetic side: the literal digit, the tail, the integral recurrence, the smooth-factor cancellation, the explicit onset and the sharp carry bound all refer to the same series, and Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-escape-endpoint">20</a> shows that the one remaining condition is the problem itself throughout an entire band of bounds. Three obstructions mark the limits. Arbitrary-order minors exclude every finite exact separation of the kernel, and Theorem <a href="#long269:res:uniform-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:uniform-rank">11</a> excludes even approximate separation of its normalised carry below half a jump. The bounded-radix alternative leaves integral tails untouched. The residue countermodels show that coprimality alone gives no denominator-independent residue bound, and Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">22</a> shows that no bounded-length search can reach the cofinal quantifier. What remains is to force the literal word’s residue outside the finite carry interval, with the window allowed to depend on the denominator and to begin beyond the onset.

#### Evidence.

Every linked phrase above opens its Lean declaration at the pinned source revision ee650b32b8b2, where the finite running-LCM geometry, the two-prime outer product, the arbitrary-order kernel minors and the exclusion of finite separation, the literal shell summability and recurrence, the all-scale rationality lattice, the rationality-to-carry bridge, the residue arithmetic and both directions of the window-escape equivalence are checked by the Lean 4 kernel against Mathlib with no `sorry`. The two-prime transcendence theorem is an ordinary proof over the cited Bugeaud–Laurent theorem and carries no Lean declaration; the quadratic tail bound, the explicit onset $`a_D`$, the sharp bound $`K`$, the equivalence band, the window-growth law and Theorem <a href="#long269:res:uniform-rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:uniform-rank">11</a> are ordinary proofs in this paper; the three finite computations of Section <a href="#long269:sec:evidence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:evidence">8</a> are computational certificates.

# Extended record: migrated arguments and finite evidence

This part of the record holds material that the short note compressed or moved. Nothing here is an additional result; every statement is either an auxiliary form of a theorem of the note, a historical or bibliographic detail, or the exact source inventory. The canonical references are the note’s own labels.

<a id="long269:long:history"></a>

## The historical and catalogue record

In the primary 1988 source Erdős states the infinite-$`P`$ assertion as a simple exercise and presents persistence for a finite number of primes greater than one as a probable extension, and not as a theorem \[erdos1988, p. 106\]. The current open status is supplied by the catalogue \[erdosproblems\], and is not inferred from that conjectural wording. The 1974 letter writes “given primes $`p_1,\ldots,p_r`$” without explicitly restricting $`r`$, so the singleton case, whose value is $`p/(p-1)`$, must be excluded by hand; the modern restriction $`|P|\ge2`$ does that.

The letter’s de-duplicated assertion is made for a general finite list of primes and supplies no proof, so it is an asserted historical result and not an open problem. The note therefore restricts its open statement to the repeated series $`\mathcal R_P`$. A recovered proof of the letter’s assertion, or a transcendence statement for $`\mathcal D_P`$ with $`|P|\ge3`$, would be a different question and needs its own formulation.

The two-prime argument of the note is independent of the unprinted argument in the letter, and it is not the first public proof. Steve Fan posted the same factorisation, the same Hecke–Mahler reduction and the same conclusion in the discussion thread of the problem’s page on 26 June 2026 \[fan2026comment\], with follow-up remarks extending the argument to arbitrary coprime pairs; a further comment there observes that the argument does not seem to generalise immediately to $`|P|\ge3`$. The manuscript of the note was first released publicly on 22 July 2026, at commit `a9d3ab8`.

The statement of the problem has been formalised as a conjecture with an unfilled proof in the *Formal Conjectures* collection \[formalconjectures269\]. Its Nat-indexed series includes the empty-prefix least-common-multiple term, so its value is exactly $`1`$ plus the conventional series; transporting a theorem across that boundary needs an explicit series-identification lemma, which is not supplied here.

## The abstract carry lemmas in their general form

The note applies the carry machinery to the literal $`\{2,3,5\}`$ orbit. The underlying statements are about integer sequences alone, they are reusable, and they are recorded here in the generality in which they are checked.

Let $`D=D_{\mathrm{sm}}B`$ with $`D_{\mathrm{sm}}=2^{u}3^{v}5^{w}`$ and $`\gcd(B,30)=1`$, and let $`(c_n)`$ be an integer sequence satisfying $`c_{n+1}=b_nc_n-Dm_n`$ for an integer radix word $`(b_n)`$ and forcing word $`(m_n)`$.

<div id="long269:long:denominator-reduction" class="proposition">

**Proposition 29** (conditional denominator reduction). *If $`c_n=D_{\mathrm{sm}}d_n`$ for every $`n`$, with $`D_{\mathrm{sm}}>0`$, then the recurrence, positivity, upper bound and window identity for $`(c_n)`$ reduce to the same four statements for $`(d_n)`$ with multiplier $`B`$ in place of $`D`$.*

</div>

Height absorption alone does not imply divisibility of a carry state. The identity $`DX_a=h_aN-Dv_a`$ of Lemma <a href="#long269:res:all-scale-lattice" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:all-scale-lattice">16</a> is what supplies it for the actual orbit, and Theorem <a href="#long269:res:actual-cancellation" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:actual-cancellation">17</a> is the instance in which the note uses it. The formal consumer takes the common-factor form as a hypothesis.

<div id="long269:long:windowconsumer" class="proposition">

**Proposition 30** (conditional extinction of bounded carries). *Let $`(b_n)`$ and $`(m_n)`$ be a radix word and a forcing word, let $`G:\mathbb{N}_{>0}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}`$, and assume cofinal local-window escape against $`G`$. Fix $`B>0`$ coprime to $`30`$. There is no integral sequence $`(d_n)`$ satisfying simultaneously $`d_{n+1}=b_nd_n-Bm_n`$, $`d_n>0`$ and $`|d_n|\le G(B,n)`$ for every $`n\ge0`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Choose one escaping window $`(\ell,h)`$. The window identity gives $`d_{\ell+h}\equiv-BF_{\ell,h}`$ modulo $`|W_{\ell,h}|`$. The endpoint state is positive and at most $`G(B,\ell+h)`$, whereas the canonical positive residue of the right-hand side exceeds that bound, so Proposition <a href="#long269:res:consumer" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:consumer">19</a> applies. ◻

</div>

Coprimality with $`30`$ is used by the escape hypothesis to select a window; once a window is fixed, the finite contradiction does not use it. The formalisation carries the edge cases: a zero window base is excluded, a zero residue is represented by the full modulus, and positivity prevents the endpoint carry from vanishing. The packaged absorbed form takes a nonzero smooth factor, the exact factorisation $`c_n=D_{\mathrm{sm}}d_n`$, the absorbed recurrence for $`(c_n)`$ and the positive short bound for $`(d_n)`$, and derives the same contradiction in one statement.

## Worked finite examples

The ten smallest values of the running least common multiple at $`\{2,3,5\}`$ are tabulated in Section <a href="#long269:sec:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:lcm">2</a>. They illustrate both parts of Proposition <a href="#long269:res:cell" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:cell">3</a>: the value is constant on $`\{5,6,7\}`$ and on $`\{9,10\}`$, and each change multiplies by a single prime, by $`2`$ at $`x=2,4,8`$, by $`3`$ at $`x=3,9`$ and by $`5`$ at $`x=5`$. Also $`\operatorname{L}(10)=8\cdot9\cdot5=360`$ is the least common multiple of the smooth numbers $`1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10`$.

For Proposition <a href="#long269:res:fibre" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:fibre">5</a> take $`(p,q,r)=(2,3,5)`$ and the box $`\mathcal B(1,1,1)`$, whose eight points carry the smooth values $`1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30`$ and the heights
``` math
\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}
p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}&1&2&3&5&6&10&15&30\\ \hline
\operatorname{H}&1&2&6&60&60&360&360&10800
\end{array}
```
Six heights occur, two of them twice: the points $`5`$ and $`6`$ share the height $`60`$, and $`10`$ and $`15`$ share the height $`360`$. The identity reads
``` math
1+\tfrac12+\tfrac16+\tfrac1{60}+\tfrac1{60}+\tfrac1{360}+\tfrac1{360}
 +\tfrac1{10800}
 =1+\tfrac12+\tfrac16+\tfrac2{60}+\tfrac2{360}+\tfrac1{10800}
 =\tfrac{18421}{10800},
```
and the two coefficients $`2`$ carry the whole content of the regrouping on this box. Where the heights are pairwise distinct the identity is a relabelling.

Multiplying block radices along a run of blocks gives the product of the jump-word letters over that run: for instance $`b_1b_2=60`$ is the product of the four multipliers at $`3,4,5,8`$. Block $`4`$ is the only one among the first six carrying an internal power in both channels, and block $`5`$ carries neither, so its radix falls back to the terminal factor alone.

## The finite-scan histogram

The scan of Section <a href="#long269:sec:evidence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:sec:evidence">8</a> covers every $`B\le5000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and every start $`100\le\ell\le3000`$, with search depth permitted to $`24`$. It tested $`3{,}869{,}934`$ pairs, found an escaping window in every case, and the distribution of first successful lengths was
``` math
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{$\begin{array}{c|rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr}
h&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15&16&17&18\\ \hline
\#&1&104&812&5437&51409&237423&735450&1431226&1132756&236752&34910&3076&521&49&8
\end{array}$}
```
The first case at the maximal observed length $`18`$ is $`B=917`$ at start $`\ell=2980`$, with endpoint jump index $`6179`$, window base $`18139852800000000`$, forcing $`13196471407660025821045`$, residue $`76322101735`$ and bound $`3896420420`$. An earlier run of the same checker over every $`B\le1000`$ coprime to $`30`$ and every start $`100\le\ell\le500`$ tested $`106{,}666`$ pairs with maximal first successful length $`14`$, whose first case is $`B=359`$ at start $`291`$, endpoint jump index $`627`$, base $`5038848000000`$, forcing $`25864575212865807`$, residue $`213175287`$ and bound $`15932659`$.

By Corollary <a href="#long269:res:no-bounded-length" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:no-bounded-length">22</a> these histograms describe a bounded region. The observed concentration at lengths $`10`$ to $`12`$ sits just above the necessary depth $`\bigl(\log_2K(B,\ell+h)-\log_215\bigr)/3`$ supplied by Proposition <a href="#long269:res:window-growth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long269:res:window-growth">21</a>, which is what a reader should expect if the residues behave like generic ones inside this range.

# Complete result-family map

This section places every registered family for this problem in the shared 70-family reader order. The five display bands control exposition only; the separate promotion state currently covers 6 families and is reported but does not hide or strengthen any family. Mathematical statements and evidence modes come from the public claim registry. Across all eight problems the public result-atom catalog contains 681 exact packet coordinates; this problem contributes 65. The recovered source catalog contains 682 rows; 1 row(s) belong to families absent from the current claim registry and remain disclosed as detached source rows. Catalog rows expose bounded statement excerpts plus full-source digests, not a claim that every complete packet statement is reproduced here.

## Weighted phase carry observer

**Reader position.** 24 of 70; display band: mechanism. Formal editorial disposition: hold. These are separate classifications.

**Reader entry.** An exact weighted-phase carry recurrence splits into a finite residue digit and an uncontrolled integral quotient coboundary; an explicit function-faithful finite-dimensional observer then forces finite realised span.

An exact weighted-phase carry recurrence splits into a finite residue digit and an uncontrolled integral quotient coboundary; an explicit function-faithful finite-dimensional observer then forces finite realised span.

**Authority and reach.** Lean kernel; locally proved result; novelty unassessed.

**Exact boundary.** The recurrence supplies a finite residue coordinate but leaves an uncontrolled integral quotient coboundary; it proves neither a finite-state quotient nor a literal infinite realised span. Finite realised span requires an explicit factorisation through a finite-dimensional function-faithful observer, and scalar evaluation alone is insufficient. No rationality or irrationality conclusion follows; the actual three-prime running-LCM bridge and cofinal escape remain open.

**Result-atom population.** 7 of 681 public coordinates. The public atom catalog groups them under this family.

**Comparator assurance.** exact selected interface; 1 executable interface(s), 0 repository-registered selected result interface(s).

**Publication placement.** This family remains in the complete long record and is not a short-note headline.

## Conditional carry escape

**Reader position.** 42 of 70; display band: frontier. Formal editorial disposition: hold. These are separate classifications.

**Reader entry.** Under the denominator-dependent cofinal local-window residue-escape predicate, no positive reduced carry can satisfy the exact multiplier recurrence together with its short bound. The load-bearing consumer is no_positive_reducedCarry_of_cofinalLocalWindowEscape; an absorbed nonzero common-factor carry reduces exactly to that consumer. CofinalLocalWindowEscape, windowBase, windowForcing, leastPositiveResidue, and the absorbed-carry bridge are subordinate finite-window mechanism evidence.

Under the denominator-dependent cofinal local-window residue-escape predicate, no positive reduced carry can satisfy the exact multiplier recurrence together with its short bound. The load-bearing consumer is no_positive_reducedCarry_of_cofinalLocalWindowEscape; an absorbed nonzero common-factor carry reduces exactly to that consumer. CofinalLocalWindowEscape, windowBase, windowForcing, leastPositiveResidue, and the absorbed-carry bridge are subordinate finite-window mechanism evidence.

**Authority and reach.** Lean kernel; Comparator-selected; conditional no-go consumer; novelty and significance unassessed.

**Exact boundary.** The representative assumes b,m : $`\mathbb{N}`$ $`\to`$ $`\mathbb{N}`$, shortBound : $`\mathbb{N}`$ $`\to`$ $`\mathbb{N}`$ $`\to`$ $`\mathbb{N}`$, CofinalLocalWindowEscape b m shortBound, and for each positive B coprime to 30 a positive integer-valued d with d(n+1) = (b n : $`\mathbb{Z}`$) d(n) $`-`$ (B : $`\mathbb{Z}`$) (m n : $`\mathbb{Z}`$) and Int.natAbs (d n) $`\le`$ shortBound B n; it then gives False. The absorbed-carry bridge additionally assumes smoothFactor $`\ne`$ 0, c n = smoothFactor \* d n, and the corresponding exact absorbed recurrence, then cancels that factor to the same reduced consumer. The cofinal local-window escape producer and the bridge from the actual three-prime running-LCM series or its rationality to this reduced carry remain open. This is not a \#269 endpoint or irrationality proof, and no actual-series identification, novelty, priority, significance, or external-review claim is made. It is one conditional window-carry family, distinct from the finite residue, rank-two, and weighted-phase observer families.

**Result-atom population.** 37 of 681 public coordinates. The public atom catalog groups them under this family.

**Comparator assurance.** exact selected interface; 1 executable interface(s), 1 repository-registered selected result interface(s).

**Publication placement.** This family is also admitted to the short note.
