For every $`e\ge1`$, the dyadic sections of Euler’s totient through level $`e`$ have rational rank $`2^e+1`$. The two zero-residue sections and the odd-residue sections form a basis, and two families of scalar reductions generate every relation. Divisibility makes an evaluation matrix diagonal modulo a prime, with nonzero diagonal entries. The construction gives rank $`k^e+1`$ in every base $`k\ge2`$ and an integral normal form. Separately, $`\sum_{n\ge1}(\varphi(n)\bmod m)2^{-n}`$ is irrational for every $`m\ge3`$, with a complete rationality classification at dyadic moduli. For $`S=\sum_{n\ge1}\varphi(n)2^{-n}`$, one nonintegral tail shift forces full-depth certificates in every sufficiently late pair of multipliers. Irrationality is equivalent to an explicit central-residue gap for every prospective denominator; its arithmetic supply remains open.

# A basis and all its relations

Set $`\varphi(0)=0`$. For $`k\ge2`$, the $`k`$-kernel consists of the sequences $`n\mapsto\varphi(k^jn+r)`$ with $`j\ge0`$ and $`0\le r<k^j`$. The following theorem gives a unique coordinate system at every finite level.

<div id="thm:kkernelrank" class="theorem">

**Theorem 2** (exact rank of every totient $`k`$-kernel truncation). *Let $`k\ge2`$ and $`e\ge1`$ be integers, write $`F^{(k)}_{j,r}(n)=\varphi(k^jn+r)`$, and put
``` math
V_{k,e}=\operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{Q}}
 \{\,F^{(k)}_{j,r}:0\le j\le e,\ 0\le r<k^j\,\}.
```
Then $`\dim_{\mathbb{Q}}V_{k,e}=k^e+1`$, and
``` math

``` math
F^{(k)}_{j,r}=C_k(t,u)\,F^{(k)}_{j-t,u},

The retained condition is $`k\nmid r`$. At $`k=6`$, for example, the residue $`r=2`$ is retained. At base $`2`$ and level $`3`$, the fifteen sections have nine coordinates; the omitted positive-residue sections satisfy

## The evaluation matrix

The two ingredients are scalar reduction and arithmetic independence. The local formula for $`\varphi`$ gives the displayed reductions. For a prime $`p\mid k`$ that does not divide $`u`$, the argument $`k^{j-t}n+u`$ is a $`p`$-adic unit, so multiplication by $`k^t`$ contributes its power of $`p`$ and one factor $`1-1/p`$. When $`p\mid u`$, the argument already contains $`p`$, and only its power contributes. This gives $`C_k(t,u)`$.

For independence, consider finitely many forms $`L_i(n)=a_in+b_i`$ with positive slopes and $`a_ib_j\ne a_jb_i`$ for $`i\ne j`$. A finite shift makes the intercepts positive. Write $`L_i=g_iA_i`$, where $`A_i`$ is primitive. Choose an odd prime $`\ell`$ avoiding the slopes, all $`g_i\varphi(g_i)`$, and the nonzero cross determinants. In row $`i`$, choose distinct primes $`q_{ij}\equiv1\pmod\ell`$ for $`j\ne i`$, outside the same finite exceptional set, and impose
``` math
L_j(n)\equiv0\pmod{q_{ij}},\qquad A_i(n)\equiv2\pmod\ell.
```
The Chinese remainder theorem combines these congruences. The resulting progression for $`A_i(n)`$ is reduced: a prime $`q_{ij}`$ dividing $`A_i(n)`$ would also divide the nonzero cross determinant; $`\ell`$ is excluded by the chosen residue; and primitivity excludes the primes of the slope. Dirichlet’s theorem supplies arbitrarily large primes $`p=A_i(n)`$ with $`p\nmid g_i`$. Only the selected affine form is made prime in this row. The diagonal value is $`\varphi(g_i)(p-1)\not\equiv0\pmod\ell`$. Each off-diagonal value is divisible by $`\ell`$, since $`q_{ij}-1`$ divides the corresponding totient. One evaluation per row gives
``` math
\bigl(\varphi(L_j(n_i))\bigr)_{i,j}
 \equiv\operatorname{diag}(u_1,\ldots,u_s)\pmod\ell,
 \qquad u_i\ne0.
```
The determinant is nonzero over $`\mathbb{Q}`$.

Apply this construction after restricting a relation among the retained sections to $`n=km+1`$. The positive-residue sections give pairwise nonproportional forms
``` math
k^{j+1}m+(k^j+r),\qquad k\nmid r,
```
and the remaining form is $`km+1`$. Equality between two affine fractions would make the residue at the larger level divisible by $`k`$. The matrix therefore eliminates every positive-residue coefficient. If $`A,B`$ are the two zero-residue coefficients, the restriction gives $`A+B\varphi(k)=0`$. Evaluation at $`n=k`$ gives $`A+Bk=0`$, since $`\varphi(k^2)=k\varphi(k)`$. As $`\varphi(k)<k`$, both coefficients vanish. The reductions give spanning and the count is
``` math
2+\sum_{j=1}^e(k^j-k^{j-1})=k^e+1.
```
This proves Theorem <a href="#thm:kkernelrank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="thm:kkernelrank">2</a>.

<div id="cor:integral-normal-form" class="corollary">

**Corollary 4** (Integral normal form). *Let $`k\ge2`$ and $`e\ge1`$. The canonical family is a $`\mathbb{Z}`$-basis of the module generated by the sections through level $`e`$. For each omitted channel $`F_i`$, write its canonical reduction as $`F_i=a_iF_{j(i)}`$, where $`j(i)`$ is retained and $`a_i`$ is a nonnegative integer. In the free abelian group on all the channels, the vectors
``` math
R_i=E_i-a_iE_{j(i)}\qquad(i\text{ omitted})
```
form a $`\mathbb{Z}`$-basis of the kernel of evaluation $`E_i\mapsto F_i`$. In particular, every integral relation has a unique integral expression in these elementary relations, and their rank is $`\sum_{j=1}^{e-1}k^j`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* The denominator $`\prod_{p\mid k,\,p\nmid u}p`$ in $`C_k(t,u)`$ divides $`k`$, so the successive channel reductions have integer scalars. They give integral coordinates in the retained family; its rational independence makes these coordinates unique over $`\mathbb{Z}`$ as well.

Now let $`x=\sum_i x_iE_i`$ evaluate to zero. For each omitted index $`i`$, subtract $`x_iR_i`$. The result is supported on retained indices and still evaluates to zero, so independence forces it to vanish. Thus the $`R_i`$ generate the integral relation module. Conversely, the coefficient at an omitted index $`i`$ in $`\sum_h c_hR_h`$ is exactly $`c_i`$: each relation has coefficient one at its own omitted coordinate and zero at all the others. This proves independence and uniqueness without dividing by any integer. There are
``` math
(1+k+\cdots+k^e)-(k^e+1)=\sum_{j=1}^{e-1}k^j
```
omitted channels. The formal statement combines the integral coordinate basis, these two-term relation vectors, and their exact rank. This complete integral normal form is [kernel-checked in Lean](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/25ef6245d15a47548c6926369ae8f1a0f0a14a80/ErdosProblems/Erdos249/PaperCompleteR8/KernelRelationBasis.lean#L398). ◻

</div>

For example, at base $`2`$ and depth $`2`$, retain $`F_{0,0},F_{1,0},F_{1,1},F_{2,1},F_{2,3}`$. The two omitted channels satisfy $`F_{2,0}=2F_{1,0}`$ and $`F_{2,2}=F_{1,1}`$, so
``` math
E_{2,0}-2E_{1,0},\qquad E_{2,2}-E_{1,1}
```
are an integral basis of all relations among the seven channels. The rank calculation alone would give two; the basis also identifies every relation and its unique coefficients.

The module here is the one generated by the channels. It is not saturated in the group of all integer-valued sequences: at base $`2`$ and $`e\ge2`$, $`\varphi(4n+3)/2`$ is integer-valued but has canonical coefficient $`1/2`$.

**Theorem 6**. *For every $`m\ge3`$,

The right zero block gives $`|T_N|\le C2^{-L}<1/q`$, hence $`T_N=0`$. The left zero block now gives $`T_{N-L-1}=a_N2^{-L-1}`$, a nonzero element of $`q^{-1}\mathbb{Z}`$ with absolute value less than $`1/q`$, a contradiction.

*Proof of Theorem <a href="#res:residueseries" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="res:residueseries">6</a>.* Fix a unit $`s\pmod m`$ and a block length $`L`$. For each nonzero $`t\in[-L,L]`$, choose a distinct prime $`q_t\equiv1\pmod m`$ larger than $`L`$ and outside the prime divisors of $`m`$. Prescribe
``` math
p\equiv s\pmod m,\qquad p\equiv-t\pmod{q_t}.

This is a reduced progression, because each $`q_t>|t|`$. Dirichlet supplies arbitrarily large primes $`p`$ in it. Then $`m\mid\varphi(p+t)`$ for every $`0<|t|\le L`$, whereas $`\varphi(p)\equiv s-1\pmod m`$.

Subtract $`f(0)`$ from the observable and clear its denominators. Whenever $`f(s-1)\ne f(0)`$, the preceding construction gives arbitrarily long bounded isolated pulses, so Lemma <a href="#lem:bounded-pulse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="lem:bounded-pulse">7</a> applies. For the least-residue map choose $`s=-1`$: its central residue is $`m-2\ne0`$ when $`m\ge3`$. For $`m=2^k`$, every even residue $`r`$ has $`r+1`$ a unit, so a nonconstant restriction to the even residues supplies such a pulse. Conversely, $`\varphi(n)`$ is even for every $`n\ge3`$. Constancy on the even classes therefore makes all terms after $`n=2`$ constant, giving the stated rational value. This converse requires no recurrent-support theorem. The three clauses together are [Lean source](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/f36a98bf3d3e6f65f1074e3b800e3293d5b8a51a/ErdosProblems/Erdos249/PaperCompleteR7/RationalObservableClassification.lean#L277). ◻

</div>

The bounded-pulse proof fixes its coefficient bound before choosing the block. For $`S`$, the termwise condition $`2^L\mid\varphi(N+L)`$, with $`N+L>1`$, forces $`2^L\le\varphi(N+L)\le N+L-1`$. Hence the tail envelope $`(N+L+2)2^{-L}>1`$ cannot exclude any positive denominator. The following criterion instead measures cancellation in a weighted prefix.

 R_N=\sum_{j\ge1}\varphi(N+j)2^{-j},\qquad
 \Delta_h(N)=R_{N+h}-R_N.
```
The prefix identity $`2^NS=\Phi_N+R_N`$, with $`\Phi_N=\sum_{n=1}^N\varphi(n)2^{N-n}\in\mathbb{Z}`$, gives
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tail-phase}
 \Delta_h(N)\equiv2^N(2^h-1)S\pmod\mathbb{Z}.

For $`h,N,L\in\mathbb{N}`$, let

   \bigl(\varphi(N+h+1+j)-\varphi(N+1+j)\bigr)2^{L-1-j},

Write $`K(h,N,L)`$ for

B<D_{h,N,L}\bmod2^L<2^L-B.

``` math
\begin{equation}

 |2^L\Delta_h(N)-D_{h,N,L}|\le B.

Thus some $`L`$ satisfies $`K(h,N,L)`$ exactly when $`\Delta_h(N)\notin\mathbb{Z}`$: necessity follows from the strict inequalities; sufficiency follows by choosing $`L`$ with $`2^L\|\Delta_h(N)\|_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}>2B`$.

Thus the positive corridor eliminates the nonnegative true survivor but does not itself produce a central-band contradiction; an independent arithmetic exclusion of the top boundary is still required. *Checked:* [positive corridor](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TotientActualLcmOrbitSign.lean#L39), [negative survivor](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TotientActualLcmOrbitSign.lean#L172), [top-edge residue](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/TotientActualLcmOrbitSign.lean#L211).

3.  <span id="res:factorideal" label="res:factorideal"></span> <span class="smallcaps">\[unconditional progress\]</span> **LCM factor-ideal shift-algebra no-go.** For every $`t\ge3`$, with $`H=\operatorname{lcm}(1,\ldots,t)`$, there is a nonzero synthetic dyadic coboundary whose forcing letters reproduce the actual totient differences at $`t-2`$ prescribed indices and lie in the ideal generated by $`\varphi(H)`$. Every finite integer shift polynomial preserves the exact coboundary cancellation, the $`H`$-factor ideal and all lower factor ideals, together with uniform state and letter bounds. A sparse-anchor variant also preserves every prescribed whole-ray anchor. Hence factor ideals, finite shift-algebra closure and these bounds cannot by themselves force a contradiction. The witness is synthetic: its letters are not claimed to be actual totient differences, nonlinear combinations are outside the theorem, and no cofinal family of certificates follows. *Checked:* [finite shift-algebra no-go](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/Erdos249257/LcmFactorIdealPulseObstruction.lean#L798).

The long record supplies a rational control with $`c(n)=\varphi(n)`$ for odd $`n`$, $`|c(n)-\varphi(n)|\le2`$ for even $`n`$, $`0\le c(n)\le n`$, and
``` math
\sum_{n\ge1}c(n)2^{-n}=\frac54.
```
It has an integral tempered carry with dyadic rank at least $`2^e-1`$ at every level. Thus the same lower bound for a hypothetical totient carry is compatible with rationality. For one fixed prime $`p`$, the exact laws $`g(pn)=p g(n)`$ when $`p\mid n`$ and $`g(pn)=(p-1)g(n)`$ otherwise, together with $`g-\varphi=o(n)`$, force $`g=\varphi`$: a nonzero defect keeps a nonzero ratio to the argument along $`p^j n`$. The control fails these laws; its full coefficient rank is asserted only at measured finite depths.

A different obstruction concerns rational approximation. Put
``` math
\Theta_2=\sum_{d\ge1}\frac{\mu(d)}{(2^d-1)^2}=S-\frac12,
 \qquad
 Q(e,Y)=\frac{\bigl(\sum_{d=1}^{Y}\mu(d)/(2^d-1)^{e+2}\bigr)^2}
 {\sum_{d=1}^{Y}\mu(d)/(2^d-1)^{2e+2}}.
```
The divisor-convolution identity gives the displayed value of $`\Theta_2`$, as recorded by Fan \[fan2026totient\]. The following exact extremum is stated in the long record as Theorem `thm:rankonefloor`; its proof is [the sharp-floor argument](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos249/RankOneSharpFloor.lean#L534) in the linked source.

<div id="res:rankonefloor" class="theorem">

**Theorem 10** (Positive rank-one floor). *For $`e\ge1`$ and $`Y\ge4`$, the denominator of $`Q(e,Y)`$ is positive, and the unique minimiser is $`(e,Y)=(1,5)`$. Every admissible quotient and every nonempty finite positive weighted average of such quotients satisfies
``` math
Q-\Theta_2>\frac{21}{320}.
```
The uniform bound $`Q-\Theta_2>1/15`$ is false already at $`(1,5)`$.*

</div>

This theorem treats averages after the quotients are formed. Signed coefficients, coupling before the quotient, and higher-rank kernels require separate arguments. For any proposed rational approximants $`p_j/q_j`$ in lowest terms, a sufficient arithmetic target is
``` math
0<q_j\left|\Theta_2-p_j/q_j\right|\longrightarrow0.
```
Ordinary convergence and Hankel nonvanishing do not contain this denominator estimate. The canonical gap <a href="#eq:canonical-gap" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:canonical-gap">[eq:canonical-gap]</a> remains the equivalent endpoint; the approximation estimate is one stronger sufficient route.

# Antecedents and proof record

Allouche and Shallit introduced $`k`$-regular sequences \[allouche-shallit\]. Coons proved that $`\varphi`$ is not $`k`$-regular \[coons\]; Martin’s stronger affine ordering theorem implies the independence in Section <a href="#sec:rank" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:rank">1.1</a> \[martin-phi-inequalities\]. The basis theorem gives the exact finite-level normal form. Wong \[wong2015\] proved least-residue irrationality when the denominator base equals the modulus; Section <a href="#sec:family" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:family">2</a> fixes base two and classifies dyadic observables. The original question appears in Erdős and Graham \[erdosgraham1980, p. 61\].

The all-base arithmetic reduction and spanning, and exact rank conditional on the explicit affine-section linear-independence hypothesis, have proofs in the supplied Lean source snapshot. The residue-series irrationality, full-depth amplification, canonical equivalence and positive rank-one floor are also Lean-checked: [amplification](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos249/FullDepthRayAmplifier.lean#L364), [canonical gap](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos249/CyclotomicAnchoredKill.lean#L3165), and [rank-one floor](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-lean-erdos249-257/blob/99f4bf47422abbd8757cbb22b50ba079d764d3a7/ErdosProblems/Erdos249/RankOneSharpFloor.lean#L624). The historical source links retain `99f4bf47422a`; the all-base module requires a matching public source supplement. The unconditional all-base basis and rank theorem is an ordinary conclusion above: it discharges the linear-independence hypothesis using Martin’s external theorem. The integral normal form also has its ordinary proof above. The periodic transport lemma is checked in `PeriodicTotientIndependence.lean`; the eventual version follows by the displayed threshold shift. The rational control and the termwise-window and prime-dilation boundaries are proved in `ParityPerturbedRationalControl.lean` and `PrefixValuationAndControlRigidity.lean`, respectively. Finite evaluation ranks and the all-level carry lower bound remain distinct. The long record retains the separate continued-fraction bounds $`q\ge2^{39989}`$ and $`q>10^{12038}`$ under rationality, alongside the Lean-checked Farey exclusion. Neither implies the universal gap.
