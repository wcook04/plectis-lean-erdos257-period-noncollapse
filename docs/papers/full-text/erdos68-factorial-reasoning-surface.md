# The Factorial-Denominator Series: Complete Reasoning Record

<div class="center">

<span class="smallcaps">Abstract</span>

</div>

Write $`d_n=n!-1`$, $`H_M=\sum_{2\le n\le M}d_n^{-1}`$ and $`L_M=\operatorname{lcm}(d_2,\ldots,d_M)`$. For a prime $`p`$ with $`e=v_p(L_M)\ge1`$, let $`J=\{n:2\le n\le M,\ v_p(d_n)=e\}`$ and write $`d_n=p^eu_n`$ on $`J`$. Then
``` math
v_p\bigl(\operatorname{den}(H_M)\bigr)=e
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \sum_{n\in J}u_n^{-1}\ne0\ \hbox{ in }\mathbb F_p,
```
the inverses being taken modulo $`p`$. The prefixes through $`138`$ and $`2592`$ cancel the primes $`139`$ and $`2593`$ completely. Second, the common denominator itself grows fast:
``` math
\liminf_{N\to\infty}\frac{\log L_N}{N^{3/2}\log N}\ \ge\ \frac{2\sqrt2}{3},
```
by an elementary segment argument that uses $`\gcd(i!-1,j!-1)\mid j!/i!-1`$ and no external multiplicity theorem. The two statements sit either side of reduction, and the cancellations at $`139`$ and $`2593`$ are why the second cannot be substituted for the first.

Wilson’s theorem gives arbitrarily late first occurrences of primes among the factorial gaps, so prefix-private prime support of the denominators occurs cofinally, with no bound relating the prime to its first hit. Four exact criteria locate the irrationality of $`S=\sum_{n\ge2}d_n^{-1}`$: a strict-successor carry equivalence, a companion-orbit residue condition, a lower-interval escape condition of width $`O(m^{-2})`$, and a boundary covering the whole shifted family $`\sum_{n\ge2}1/(n!+t)`$ for every integer $`t\ge-1`$, whose member $`t=0`$ returns the irrationality of $`e`$. A finite-channel radius bound gives $`3t^3<2(R+1)`$ under the exact cancellation and factorial-size hypotheses, and the growth statement above raises the asymptotic constant in that estimate from $`3/2`$ to $`16/9`$. Two finite computations exclude denominators: $`q\nmid299999!`$ from an exact interval carry census through $`300000`$, and the kernel-checked bounds $`q\ge2^{39990}`$ and $`q>10^{12040}`$ from a certified continued-fraction enclosure. The factorial-grid exclusion uses the external GMP computation and remains a separate outstanding Lean obligation. The irrationality of $`S`$ is open, and the remaining arithmetic inputs are stated in the last section.

# Which prime powers survive reduction

<div id="long68:res:problem" class="problem">

**Problem 1** (Erdős \#68). Is $`S=\sum_{n\ge2}(n!-1)^{-1}`$ irrational?

</div>

Erdős states the question on p. 102 of his 1988 survey and, in the same passage, records the expectation that $`\sum_n1/(n!+t)`$ is irrational, indeed transcendental, for every integer $`t`$ \[erdos1988, p. 102\]. That is conjectural context. Numbering and current status follow [Bloom’s Erdős problem catalogue](https://www.erdosproblems.com/68) \[bloom\]; the problem is open.

Put
``` math
d_n=n!-1,\qquad H_M=\sum_{n=2}^{M}\frac1{d_n},\qquad
 L_M=\operatorname{lcm}(d_2,\ldots,d_M),\qquad
 A_M=\sum_{n=2}^{M}\frac{L_M}{d_n},
```
so that $`H_M=A_M/L_M`$. Throughout, $`\operatorname{den}(x)`$ is the positive denominator of a rational number in lowest terms. The first question is which prime power present in $`L_M`$ remains in $`\operatorname{den}(H_M)`$.

<span id="long68:res:lead-prime-pole" label="long68:res:lead-prime-pole"></span>

<div id="long68:res:prime-pole" class="theorem">

**Theorem 2** (maximal prime-power survival). *Let $`M\ge2`$, let $`p`$ be a prime dividing $`L_M`$, and put $`e=v_p(L_M)`$. Let $`J=\{n:2\le n\le M,\ v_p(d_n)=e\}`$ and write $`d_n=p^eu_n`$ for $`n\in J`$. Then, with inverses in $`\mathbb F_p`$,
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:prime-pole-survival}
 v_p\bigl(\operatorname{den}(H_M)\bigr)=e
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \sum_{n\in J}u_n^{-1}\ne0\quad\hbox{in }\mathbb F_p.
\end{equation}
```*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Write $`L_M=p^eW`$ with $`p\nmid W`$. If $`v_p(d_n)<e`$, then $`p\mid L_M/d_n`$. If $`n\in J`$, then $`u_n(L_M/d_n)=W`$, so $`L_M/d_n\equiv Wu_n^{-1}\pmod p`$. Summing over $`2\le n\le M`$ gives
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:prime-pole-residue}
 A_M\equiv \frac{L_M}{p^e}\sum_{n\in J}u_n^{-1}\pmod p.
\end{equation}
```
The historical manuscript cites `Erdos68/PaperCompletePrimePole.lean`, line 118. This module is absent from the retained source pin; this citation does not establish kernel verification at that pin.

Finally $`\operatorname{den}(H_M)=L_M/\gcd(A_M,L_M)`$, whose $`p`$-valuation is $`e`$ exactly when $`p\nmid A_M`$. Since $`W`$ is invertible modulo $`p`$, that is exactly the stated condition. ◻

</div>

The criterion decides the survival of the full exponent $`e`$. A zero residue gives $`v_p(\operatorname{den}(H_M))<e`$, and further congruences are needed to determine the surviving exponent. The proof uses no property of factorials beyond the displayed denominators, so it applies to any finite sum of reciprocals. It is the first valuation layer of the reciprocal-sum formula of Louwsma and Martino \[louwsma-martino, Lemma 4.1, p. 10\]. What is specific here is the behaviour of the actual family $`d_n=n!-1`$, and that behaviour is not generic.

<a id="two-complete-cancellations."></a>

#### Two complete cancellations.

Take $`M=p-1`$. The indices below with $`p\mid d_n`$ are all of them, and every one has valuation exactly one.

<div class="center">

|    $`p`$ | indices $`n`$         | $`d_n/p\pmod p`$       | inverses modulo $`p`$ |
|---------:|:----------------------|:-----------------------|:----------------------|
|  $`139`$ | $`69,\ 122,\ 137`$    | $`6,\ 49,\ 73`$        | $`116,\ 122,\ 40`$    |
| $`2593`$ | $`349,\ 2243,\ 2591`$ | $`1508,\ 1566,\ 1678`$ | $`1367,\ 356,\ 870`$  |

</div>

The inverse sums are $`278=2\cdot139`$ and $`2593`$. By Theorem <a href="#long68:res:prime-pole" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:prime-pole">2</a>, $`139\nmid\operatorname{den}(H_{138})`$ and $`2593\nmid\operatorname{den}(H_{2592})`$: each prime divides the common denominator of its prefix and vanishes from the reduced one. Both hit lists and both valuations are checked by the recurrence
``` math
r_1=1,\qquad r_n\equiv nr_{n-1}\pmod{p^2},\qquad 0\le r_n<p^2,
```
run through $`n=p-1`$. A hit is an index with $`r_n\equiv1\pmod p`$, its lifted cofactor is $`(r_n-1)/p`$ modulo $`p`$, and valuation two would mean $`r_n=1`$, which occurs at neither prime. That enumeration is a finite calculation separate from the theorem.

A prime is *prefix-private at $`m`$* when it divides $`d_m`$ and divides none of $`d_2,\ldots,d_{m-1}`$.

<div id="long68:res:wilson-cofinality" class="proposition">

**Proposition 3** (cofinal first prime occurrences). *For every integer $`B\ge0`$ there are a prime $`q`$ and an integer $`m>B`$ with $`m<q`$, $`q\mid m!-1`$ and $`\gcd(q,k!-1)=1`$ for every $`k`$ with $`2\le k<m`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Choose a prime $`q\ge B!+5`$. Wilson’s theorem gives $`(q-2)!\equiv1\pmod q`$, so the set of indices $`n\ge2`$ with $`q\mid n!-1`$ is nonempty and contains no element above $`q-2`$; let $`m`$ be its least element. If $`m\le B`$, then $`q\le m!-1\le B!-1`$, contradicting the choice of $`q`$. Hence $`m>B`$, and minimality gives the coprimality assertions. ◻

</div>

The construction gives no useful upper bound for $`q`$ in terms of its first hit, and that comparison is what the scale inequalities of §<a href="#long68:sec:residue" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:sec:residue">4</a> consume. Wilson reflection limits what can be inferred from a large prime factor alone: for odd $`n<q`$ with $`q\mid n!-1`$, the identity $`(q-1-n)!\,n!\equiv(-1)^{n+1}\pmod q`$ gives a second hit at $`q-n-1`$. The reflection identity is classical; see Stewart \[stewart2004, p. 462, (4)\].

*Status.* The problem treated here is open, and this note does not close it. Every statement below marked as checked is a proposition that the pinned Lean kernel accepts from the sources this note links to, with no `sorry`, no added axiom, and no unchecked evaluation. That is a claim about the formal statement, not about its mathematical interest, its novelty, or the original problem. The unresolved obligations are named exactly, in their own section, and none of the finite computations, reductions, or no-go results here removes one of them.

*Companion system context.* The [claim and trust boundary](../../../claim-faithful-publication-systems-paper.pdf#nameddest=systems-trust), [cold-clone route to proof authority](../../../cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf#nameddest=cold-clone-authority), and [public contribution protocol](../../../open-source-mathematics-strategy.pdf#nameddest=strategy-protocol) are described in sibling papers. Those descriptions do not change the mathematical status of this note.

# The growth of the common denominator

Theorem <a href="#long68:res:prime-pole" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:prime-pole">2</a> concerns the denominator after reduction. The common denominator before reduction admits an unconditional lower bound of its own, by an elementary argument.

Since $`j!/i!\ge i+1>1`$, the positive integer $`j!/i!-1`$ is a multiple of $`g`$, whence $`g\le j!/i!-1`$. Finally $`j!/i!`$ is a product of $`j-i`$ integers each at most $`j`$. ◻

*Proof.* Fix $`\alpha>0`$ and take $`k=\lfloor\alpha\sqrt N\rfloor`$, which satisfies $`2\le k\le N-1`$ for all large $`N`$. Put $`u=N-k+1`$.

For the left-hand side of <a href="#long68:eq:segment" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:segment">[long68:eq:segment]</a>, use $`n!-1\ge n!/2`$ and $`\log n!\ge n\log n-n`$. Since $`n\mapsto n\log n-n`$ increases,
``` math
\sum_{n=u}^{N}\log(n!-1)\ \ge\ k\,(u\log u-u)-k\log2 .

Here $`u\ge N-\alpha\sqrt N`$ and $`k=\alpha\sqrt N+O(1)`$, so $`k\,u\log u=\alpha N^{3/2}\log N+O(N\log N)`$, while $`k\,u=O(N^{3/2})`$ and $`k\log2=O(\sqrt N)`$. Hence the left-hand side is $`\alpha N^{3/2}\log N+o(N^{3/2}\log N)`$.

For the right-hand side, $`\binom{k+1}{3}\le(k+1)^3/6`$, so $`\binom{k+1}{3}\log N=\tfrac{\alpha^3}{6}N^{3/2}\log N+o(N^{3/2}\log N)`$. Therefore
``` math
\liminf_{N\to\infty}\frac{\log L_N}{N^{3/2}\log N}
 \ \ge\ \alpha-\frac{\alpha^3}{6}.

The right-hand side is maximised at $`\alpha=\sqrt2`$, with value $`\sqrt2-\tfrac{2\sqrt2}{6}=\tfrac{2\sqrt2}{3}`$. ◻

The proof is an ordinary proof and is not kernel-checked. Its two ingredients are Lemmas <a href="#long68:res:product-lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:product-lcm">4</a> and <a href="#long68:res:gap-gcd" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:gap-gcd">5</a>, and it needs no factorial-congruence multiplicity theorem. A weaker exponent $`4/3`$ follows instead from Theorem 12 of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski \[garaev-luca-shparlinski, arXiv v1, Thm. 12, p. 16\], which bounds by $`O(N^{2/3})`$ the number of solutions of $`n!\equiv a\pmod r`$ with $`r`$ prime, $`a\not\equiv0\pmod r`$, and $`H+1\le n\le H+N`$ where $`0\le H<H+N<r`$; that deduction is recorded in the complete reasoning record and is superseded here. No antecedent for a lower bound on the least common multiple of the numbers $`n!-1`$ was located, and the searches were for factorial values shifted by one; least common multiples of consecutive integers and of linear recurrences are a different family. The finding is that the statement is possibly known and was not located.

The constant $`2\sqrt2/3`$ is the best this argument gives. The gain from a block of $`k`$ indices is largest at the top of the range and the pairwise-gcd loss grows with the spread, so consecutive top indices are simultaneously optimal for both terms, and the bound $`j!/i!<N^{\,j-i}`$ is sharp to first order there. Convergence is slow: the omitted term $`-ku`$ is of order $`N^{3/2}`$, so the finite ratio falls short of the limit by about $`\sqrt2/\log N`$.

Theorem <a href="#long68:res:lcm-growth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:lcm-growth">7</a> is a statement about $`L_N`$ and not about $`\operatorname{den}(H_N)`$. Theorem <a href="#long68:res:prime-pole" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:prime-pole">2</a> and the cancellations at $`139`$ and $`2593`$ show why the substitution fails: a prime may occupy the common denominator and be absent from the reduced one. Bounding the reduced denominator from below at every index is a stronger assertion, and it is exactly what an irrationality proof through the clearing-scale route needs.

Suppose $`S=a/q`$ and $`q\mid(m-1)!`$. For $`j=m-1`$ and $`j=m`$ the number $`j!\,S`$ is an integer, and $`j!H_j=j!\,S-E_j`$ with $`0<E_j<1`$ by <a href="#long68:eq:tail-bound" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:tail-bound">[long68:eq:tail-bound]</a>, so $`Z_j=j!\,S`$.

## Why one proposed window argument is circular

One route to cofinal non-unit carries tries to exclude two consecutive unit carries by extracting a prime-power or quotient-gcd obstruction from their cleared width-one window. The exact two-step recurrence shows what that window can deliver. Let $`U_k`$ and $`V_k`$ be the numerator and denominator of the reduced predecessor gap and let $`G_k>0`$ be the exact transition normaliser. For $`m\ge3`$, the two unit carries are equivalent to an integer offset $`\Omega_m`$ with $`0<\Omega_m\le D_m`$, the window denominator telescopes independently of the carry values,
``` math
D_m=V_{m+2}G_{m+1}G_m=V_m(m!-1)\bigl((m+1)!-1\bigr),
```
and under the pair assumption the offset factors to match, $`\Omega_m=U_{m+2}G_{m+1}G_m`$. Cancelling the common positive normaliser reduces the complete window to
``` math
0<U_{m+2}\le V_{m+2},
```
which every reduced positive gap in $`(0,1]`$ already satisfies. For that specified window, therefore, an obstruction obtained only after imposing the carry pair rewrites a bound that holds anyway. The calculation does not disprove adjacent unit carries and does not exclude an independent restriction on the transition numerators or their valuations, which would need its own argument constraining the predecessor state before the pair is assumed.

<a id="the-companion-coordinate"></a>

## The companion coordinate

Let $`C=\sum_{n\ge2}\bigl(n!(n!-1)\bigr)^{-1}`$. The identity $`1/(n!-1)=1/n!+1/(n!(n!-1))`$ and absolute convergence give
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:companion-decomposition}
 S=C+e-2 .
\end{equation}
```
The canonical factorial digits of a real $`x`$ are $`a_m(x)=\lfloor m!x\rfloor-m\lfloor(m-1)!x\rfloor\in\{0,\ldots,m-1\}`$, and $`x`$ is rational exactly when they vanish from some index on. That criterion is due to Cantor \[cantor1869\] and is recorded in Galambos \[galambos1976, Ch. 1\].

*Proof.* Put $`J_m=\sum_{k=0}^{m}m!/k!`$. Then $`J_m`$ is an integer, every summand with $`k<m`$ is divisible by $`m`$ and the summand at $`k=m`$ is $`1`$, so $`J_m\equiv1\pmod m`$; and $`0<m!\,e-J_m<1`$ for $`m\ge2`$.

Multiplying <a href="#long68:eq:companion-decomposition" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:companion-decomposition">[long68:eq:companion-decomposition]</a> by $`m!`$ and using $`\lfloor -m!\,e\rfloor=-J_m-1`$ gives $`\lfloor m!C\rfloor=m!\,S+2\,m!-J_m-1\equiv-2\pmod m`$.

Conversely, assume the congruence from some index on. Because $`0\le a_m(C)<m`$, for $`m\ge3`$ the congruence is equivalent to $`a_m(C)=m-2`$. Choose $`N`$ beyond the exceptional indices. The canonical expansion gives
``` math
C=\frac{\lfloor N!C\rfloor}{N!}+\sum_{m>N}\frac{m-2}{m!},
```
and the telescope $`\sum_{m>N}(m-1)/m!=1/N!`$ turns this into
``` math
S=C+e-2
 =\frac{\lfloor N!C\rfloor+1}{N!}+\sum_{m=2}^{N}\frac1{m!},
```
which is rational. ◻

## Escape from a smaller interval

Write $`\theta_m=\{m!\,S\}`$. The exact lower interval has width $`E_m/m\in(0,2/m^2)`$, so the target shrinks quadratically.

Cofinally many instances of <a href="#long68:eq:finite-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:finite-escape">[long68:eq:finite-escape]</a> therefore imply $`S\notin\mathbb{Q}`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* If $`S`$ is rational, the remainders $`\theta_{m-1}`$ vanish eventually while $`E_m>0`$, so the escape inequality fails eventually. Conversely, suppose $`m\theta_{m-1}<E_m`$ for every sufficiently large $`m`$. By <a href="#long68:eq:tail-bound" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:tail-bound">[long68:eq:tail-bound]</a> this gives $`m\theta_{m-1}<1`$, so $`a_m(S)=0`$ and $`\theta_m=m\theta_{m-1}`$. A positive remainder grows past one under that recurrence, so the remainders vanish and $`S`$ is rational.

For the finite implication, suppose $`m\theta_{m-1}<E_m`$. The tail recurrence is $`mE_{m-1}=1+\varepsilon_m+E_m`$, so $`E_{m-1}>E_m/m>\theta_{m-1}\ge0`$, and with $`0<E_{m-1}<1`$ the strict-successor identity gives $`\Delta_m=E_{m-1}-\theta_{m-1}`$. Hence
``` math
1+\varepsilon_m<m\Delta_m=1+\varepsilon_m+E_m-m\theta_{m-1}
 \le1+\varepsilon_m+E_m<1+\varepsilon_m+\frac2m,

Escape at a single index does not give a non-unit carry there. The exact classification is

so the maximal-digit branch is available. It is realised: at $`m=52`$ exact rational arithmetic gives $`b_{52}=1`$ together with $`52\,\Delta_{52}>1+\varepsilon_{52}+2/52`$, the margin being about $`0.5689674908`$. Since $`52`$ is composite, this settles nothing about prime indices, and the cofinal statement in Proposition <a href="#long68:res:lower-escape" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:lower-escape">10</a> does not identify escape with a non-unit carry.

<a id="the-whole-shifted-family"></a>

## The whole shifted family

Erdős asked about $`S`$ inside a family, and the same coordinate covers the family. For an integer $`t\ge-1`$ put $`S_t=\sum_{n\ge2}1/(n!+t)`$ and $`C_t=\sum_{n\ge2}1/\bigl(n!(n!+t)\bigr)`$, so that $`S_t=-tC_t+(e-2)`$.

<div id="long68:res:shift-family" class="theorem">

**Theorem 11** (uniform family boundary). *For every integer $`t\ge-1`$, the series $`S_t`$ is rational exactly when
``` math
\bigl\lceil t\,m!\,C_t\bigr\rceil\equiv2\pmod m
```
for all sufficiently large $`m`$, and irrational exactly when that residue is missed cofinally. The member $`t=-1`$ is $`S`$, and the member $`t=0`$ is $`e-2`$, whose orbit is constantly $`0`$ and therefore misses the residue class at every $`m\ge3`$, so the boundary returns the irrationality of $`e`$.*

</div>

The $`t=0`$ specialisation recovers a classical fact and is included because it is the one member of the family the criterion decides, which fixes the sense in which the criterion is exact. For every other $`t`$ the producer of cofinal misses is missing, and the family is open.

# From denominator structure to a scale criterion

For an integer $`p\ge3`$ put $`I_p=\{2,\ldots,2p-1\}`$ and $`F_p=(p-1)!`$, and define
``` math
\begin{align*}
 D_p&=\operatorname{lcm}_{\substack{i,j\in I_p\\ i<j}}\gcd(d_i,d_j),
 &C_p&=\operatorname{lcm}(F_p,D_p),\\
 L^{\mathrm{blk}}_p&=\operatorname{lcm}(F_p,d_2,\ldots,d_{2p-1}),
 &R_p&=L^{\mathrm{blk}}_p/C_p .
\end{align*}
```
The normalised core is $`\widetilde C_p=C_p/F_p`$, so that
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:core-normalisation}
 L^{\mathrm{blk}}_p=C_pR_p=F_p\widetilde C_pR_p .
\end{equation}
```
The historical manuscript cites `Erdos68/PaperCompleteExisting.lean`, line 125. This module is absent from the retained source pin; this citation does not establish kernel verification at that pin.

The factorial base $`F_p`$ belongs inside every one of these quantities, and omitting it changes the scale comparisons below by a factorial factor. Put
``` math
T_p=\sum_{i\in I_p}\frac{L^{\mathrm{blk}}_p}{d_i},\qquad
 \rho_p=(-T_p)\bmod R_p,\qquad
 K_p=2p^2(2p-1)! ,
```
with $`\rho_p`$ the least nonnegative representative. All of these depend only on a finite prefix.

The core records every prime-power layer occurring in at least two gaps, together with the base. A prime dividing $`R_p`$ therefore has a unique maximal-valuation gap above the base valuation, so the argument of Theorem <a href="#long68:res:prime-pole" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:prime-pole">2</a> applies to it and gives $`\gcd(T_p,R_p)=1`$. This is where the first theorem returns. Consequently, when $`R_p>1`$, the ratio $`T_p/R_p=C_pH_{2p-1}`$ is not an integer and

For the other side, $`1/(n!-1)<2/n!`$ for $`n\ge3`$, and a geometric majorant gives

# A limitation of finite-channel cancellation

For a finitely supported integer vector $`c=(c_i)`$ on indices $`i\ge2`$, put

 W_{d,i}=\frac{i!}{(d!)^{\lfloor i/d\rfloor}},\qquad
 V_{d}(c)=\sum_i c_iW_{d,i}\quad(d\ge2).
```
Each $`W_{d,i}`$ is an integer: writing $`i=kd+r`$ with $`0\le r<d`$, the quotient $`i!/\bigl((d!)^kr!\bigr)`$ is a multinomial coefficient. Since $`i!=(d!)^{\lfloor i/d\rfloor}W_{d,i}`$ and $`d!\equiv1\pmod{d!-1}`$,

</div>

The hard step is the constant quotient; no valuation estimate enters. A nonzero moment therefore cannot be hidden entirely below $`2d`$ while the $`d`$-channel cancels. This is a finite-family obstruction: it constructs no cancelling family and says nothing about simultaneous channels or residual size.

Consequently a vanishing $`d`$-th channel forces $`(d!-1)\mid M(c)`$, and annihilating every channel $`2\le d\le D`$ forces $`L_D\mid M(c)`$, where $`L_D=\operatorname{lcm}_{2\le d\le D}(d!-1)`$ is the same quantity as in §<a href="#long68:sec:lcm" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:sec:lcm">2</a>. Every zero-moment variation of the support changes a normalised channel contribution by an integer only, so such variations cannot manufacture an extra fractional cancellation coordinate.

## The exact low-channel lattice and residual class

The integral divisor basis makes the preceding divisibility statement exact. Let $`U_n`$ be the isolated $`n`$-channel unit, let $`K_D`$ be the canonical vector with moment $`L_D`$ and channels $`2,\ldots,D`$ equal to zero, and write $`a_D=[e_1]K_D`$ and $`u_n=[e_1]U_n`$. Every vector with zero initial coordinate and vanishing channels through $`D`$ has a unique expression

 c=tK_D+\sum_{n>D}z_nU_n,
 \qquad M(c)=tL_D,

```
with finitely many nonzero integers $`z_n`$. Requiring support on $`n\ge2`$ adds precisely the scalar equation

\label{long68:eq:low-channel-support}
 ta_D+\sum_{n>D}z_nu_n=0.

The moments of finite integer vectors supported on $`n\ge2`$ and cancelling all channels $`2,\ldots,D`$ are exactly $`\mu_D\mathbb{Z}`$.

Suppose $`r\le ct^3`$ for arbitrarily large $`t`$, with $`c<16/9`$ fixed. On that subsequence $`r\log r\le ct^3(3\log t+\log c)=\bigl(3c+o(1)\bigr)t^3\log t`$, and $`3c<16/3`$ contradicts the lower bound for large $`t`$. ◻

</div>

This corollary is asymptotic, and it does not give the strict finite inequality $`R+1>\tfrac{16}9t^3`$ at every large $`t`$. The finite logarithmic constraint of the channel argument is compatible with equality $`9(R+1)=16t^3`$ for $`t\ge4`$, so that constraint alone cannot force a strict finite endpoint at $`16/9`$. The two statements are separate, and Corollary <a href="#long68:res:radius-constant" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:radius-constant">18</a> rests on the ordinary proof of Theorem <a href="#long68:res:lcm-growth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:lcm-growth">7</a>; the kernel-checked finite theorem does not carry it.

The congruence <a href="#long68:eq:channel-congruence" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:channel-congruence">[long68:eq:channel-congruence]</a> also explains the prime-channel corrector.

<div id="long68:res:translator" class="theorem">

**Theorem 19** (two-term prime channel corrector). *Let $`p\ge3`$ be prime and let $`c_{p-1}=p`$, $`c_p=-1`$, with every other coefficient zero. Then $`M(c)=0`$, $`V_{p}(c)=p!-1`$, and $`V_{d}(c)=0`$ for every $`d\ge2`$ with $`d\ne p`$.*

</div>

<div class="proof">

*Proof.* Since $`p\ge3`$, both indices $`p-1`$ and $`p`$ lie in the prescribed coefficient domain $`i\ge2`$. The moment is $`p\,(p-1)!-p!=0`$. For $`2\le d<p`$ the quotient identity $`\lfloor(p-1)/d\rfloor=\lfloor p/d\rfloor`$ holds, since $`d\nmid p`$, so the two channel weights carry the same power of $`d!`$ and the channel evaluates to $`p\,(p-1)!/(d!)^{\lfloor p/d\rfloor}-p!/(d!)^{\lfloor p/d\rfloor}=0`$. For $`d>p`$ both indices lie below $`d`$, so both weights are the plain factorials and the same cancellation occurs. At $`d=p`$ the weights are $`(p-1)!`$ and $`p!/p!=1`$, giving $`p\,(p-1)!-1=p!-1`$. ◻

</div>

For $`p=2`$, the same auxiliary identities would require $`c_1=2`$. They do not define an admissible corrector on the domain $`i\ge2`$, since every vector supported on that domain has $`c_1=0`$.

At zero cost in the moment this supplies a unit in the $`p`$-channel: adding an integer multiple of the corrector to any candidate kernel shifts the $`p`$-channel by multiples of $`p!-1`$ and leaves the moment and every other channel fixed. For every channel rank and every prescribed cutoff there is a factorial-grid kernel together with a remote prime-corrector pair entirely beyond that cutoff, with all requested low channels zero, nonzero moment, and residual in $`[-1/2,1/2]`$. What is missing is strict nonvanishing: nothing here rules out the rounded residual being exactly zero, and no cofinal family with a strictly nonzero rounded residual has been produced.

# Finite denominator exclusions

<span id="long68:res:lead-denominator-exclusions" label="long68:res:lead-denominator-exclusions"></span>

Two finite computations constrain a hypothetical denominator $`q`$ in $`S=a/q`$, and they constrain different features of it:
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:finite-bounds}
 q\nmid299999!,\qquad q\ge2^{39990},\qquad q>10^{12040}.
\end{equation}
```
The size bounds hold for every integer $`a`$ and positive natural $`q`$ with $`S=a/q`$; no reducedness assumption is needed. They are [kernel-checked in Lean](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/25ef6245d15a47548c6926369ae8f1a0f0a14a80/ErdosProblems/Erdos68/PaperCompleteFiniteSizeCertificate.lean#L58). The factorial-grid exclusion $`q\nmid299999!`$ is supported separately by the external GMP computation. It is not a conclusion of the linked Lean theorem; the full factorial-grid certificate remains an outstanding formal obligation.

Neither implies the other. A denominator with no prime factor above $`299999`$ can still fail to divide $`299999!`$ by carrying one prime to a high power, and a denominator far below $`2^{39990}`$ can still fail that divisibility; a magnitude bound above $`299999!`$ would imply it, and no such bound is available here.

The first exclusion comes from an exact interval carry census. An independently implemented GMP integer computation certifies all $`299998`$ carry cells for $`3\le m\le300000`$ with a scale of $`2^{5025679}`$ and $`96`$ guard bits, using no floating-point arithmetic; at every step the outward interval is proved to lie inside one half-open unit cell before the carry is recorded. Its unit carries occur exactly at
``` math
52,\ 591,\ 1030,\ 1407,\ 1438,\ 2164,\ 4258,\ 10991,\ 21236,
```
so $`b_{300000}\ne1`$. Theorem <a href="#long68:res:carry-equivalence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:carry-equivalence">8</a> then gives $`q\nmid299999!`$ and in particular $`q\ge300000`$. The receipt is `verification/erdos68-strict-successor.json`, schema `erdos68_strict_successor_exact_interval_v1`, payload digest `2974e8629f5959bdfa2814b63a9522cc9bf46e9e6ab99aaff28a8e980e1a1ee0`, recording the parameters above, the digests of the driver and backend used on its own run, the event-trace digest and the final enclosure. A later supplied provenance record matches the receipt and both current driver hashes, so the previously outstanding source-current regeneration check is discharged at that exact scope; the census was not rerun as part of the present paper review. The driver `scripts/check_erdos68_strict_successor.py` and the backend `scripts/check_erdos68_strict_successor_gmp.cpp` accompany it, and their current hashes match the supplied provenance. The same driver replayed independently at $`m\le4000`$ reproduces the unit-carry prefix $`52,591,1030,1407,1438,2164`$ with a non-unit carry at the endpoint, which gives $`q\ge4000`$ on its own. The census is a separate computation from the Lean development, and the implication it feeds is the kernel-checked one.

The second exclusion has a short integer description. Put $`D=2^{80000}`$ and let $`N`$ be the first integer with $`N!-1>D`$. Define
``` math
\ell=\sum_{n=2}^{N-1}\left\lfloor\frac D{n!-1}\right\rfloor,
 \qquad
 u=\ell+(N-2)+\left\lfloor\frac{2D}{N!-1}\right\rfloor+1 .
```
Each rounded prefix term loses less than one, and $`(n+1)!-1>(n+1)(n!-1)`$ makes the tail from $`N`$ smaller than $`2/(N!-1)`$, so $`\ell/D<S<u/D`$. Here $`N=7054`$ and $`u-\ell=7053`$. Apply the continued-fraction algorithm to both endpoints at once, retaining a quotient only while the integer parts agree and both remainders are nonzero, and reversing the endpoint order at each inversion. There are $`23449`$ common quotients, and the convergent denominators
``` math
Q_{-2}=1,\quad Q_{-1}=0,\quad Q_j=a_jQ_{j-1}+Q_{j-2}
```
satisfy $`Q_{23448}\ge2^{39990}`$. Every rational in the open enclosure shares this initial segment, so its reduced denominator is at least $`Q_{23448}`$; the argument is about a common prefix and does not require the last convergent to lie inside the enclosure. A newer exact width-$`7056`$ Farey certificate places the enclosure between neighbours with denominator sum $`B+E`$, and checks $`B+E>10^{12040}`$. This separate denominator-sum comparison supplies the strict decimal bound in <a href="#long68:eq:finite-bounds" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:finite-bounds">[long68:eq:finite-bounds]</a>; it does not follow from $`2^{39990}`$. The older width-$`7053`$ computation described here remains a distinct historical certificate. The [integer replay](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/cd3bd6fe245867a435e15d503ccedd699c5d02e2/scripts/check_erdos68_continued_fraction.py) and its [receipt](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/blob/cd3bd6fe245867a435e15d503ccedd699c5d02e2/verification/erdos68-continued-fraction.json) record scale $`80000`$ bits, bracket width $`7053`$, $`23449`$ certified partial quotients, power-of-two exponent $`39990`$ and strict decimal exponent $`12038`$.

Both certificates are finite. A refinement of either enlarges the excluded range and returns a statement of the same shape, and neither excludes an eventual unit-carry tail. The continued-fraction method is classical, and no antecedent for these particular numerical outputs was located.

# The remaining arithmetic inputs

The exact target is <a href="#long68:eq:strict-misses" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:strict-misses">[long68:eq:strict-misses]</a>, equivalently <a href="#long68:eq:lower-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:lower-escape">[long68:eq:lower-escape]</a>. The routes below are sufficient conditions for it, and their quantitative hypotheses are unproved. None of them is an equivalent reformulation of the problem.

<a id="weighted-collisions-and-complementary-residues."></a>

#### Weighted collisions and complementary residues.

On the tailored moving-factor blocks, the local half of <a href="#long68:eq:factor-split" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:factor-split">[long68:eq:factor-split]</a> is
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:weighted-target}
 \log\widetilde C_p
 <\log\left(\frac{2p^2}{2p+1}\cdot
       \frac{\prod_{j=p}^{2p-1}j}{q}\right),
\end{equation}
```
and the global half is <a href="#long68:eq:global-scale" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:global-scale">[long68:eq:global-scale]</a>. Both must hold on the same cofinal family. For a prime $`r`$ absent from the base $`F_p`$, the contribution to $`v_r(\widetilde C_p)`$ counts the levels $`e\ge1`$ at which at least two gaps in $`I_p`$ are divisible by $`r^e`$; for a prime dividing $`F_p`$ the base valuation must first be removed, so the layer count is $`v_r(\widetilde C_p)=\#\{e\ge1:h_{r,\,e+v_r(F_p)}(p)>1\}`$ with $`h_{r,e}(p)=\#\{i\in I_p:r^e\mid i!-1\}`$. A spacing bound $`h_{r,e}(p)(e+1)\le2p+e-2`$ is available. An unweighted count of collisions does not establish <a href="#long68:eq:weighted-target" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:weighted-target">[long68:eq:weighted-target]</a>, and reflected hits may not be discarded, since Wilson reflection produces genuine collision primes. Theorem 12 of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski \[garaev-luca-shparlinski, arXiv v1, Thm. 12, p. 16\] is a multiplicity bound and supplies no lower bound for the complementary residue in <a href="#long68:eq:global-scale" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:global-scale">[long68:eq:global-scale]</a>.

<a id="repeated-support-valuation-amplification."></a>

#### Repeated-support valuation amplification.

Write $`\Delta_n=u_n/v_n`$ in lowest terms, let $`B_n`$ be the part of $`n!-1`$ supported on primes occurring in an earlier gap, and put
``` math
A_n=\prod_{\substack{r\mid B_n\\ v_r(v_n)<v_r(n!-1)}}r^{\,v_r(n!-1)} .
```
What is established is $`A_n\mid v_{n+1}`$ and, when $`A_n>1`$, $`u_{n+1}\not\equiv0\pmod{A_n}`$. A sufficient quantitative goal, at cofinally many genuinely nonterminal indices $`n`$, is the following with $`m=n+1`$ and $`d=A_n`$:
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:amplification-target}
 \bigl((m+2)m!-2\bigr)v_m
 \le m^2(m!-1)\,(u_m\bmod d).
\end{equation}
```
It implies the upper alternative of <a href="#long68:eq:finite-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:finite-escape">[long68:eq:finite-escape]</a>. A nonzero least representative can equal one while the modulus is enormous, so divisibility and logarithmic mass do not by themselves bound that representative. A lower bound for $`\log A_n`$, and an infinitude of square lifts, are separate possible inputs, and each needs a further implication to reach <a href="#long68:eq:amplification-target" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:amplification-target">[long68:eq:amplification-target]</a>.

<a id="lower-interval-escape."></a>

#### Lower-interval escape.

Prove <a href="#long68:eq:finite-escape" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:finite-escape">[long68:eq:finite-escape]</a> at arbitrarily large indices; restricting to primes is sufficient. The upper alternative is exactly $`\bigl((m+2)m!-2\bigr)v_m\le m^2(m!-1)u_m`$. Replacing $`u_m`$ by its least nonnegative residue modulo a specified divisor of $`v_m`$ gives a stronger sufficient test. Congruence recurrences alone do not count: synthetic models satisfy the available congruences while remaining in the unit-carry branch, and a zero canonical digit is a different event from membership in this Archimedean interval.

<a id="doubled-prime-branch-failure."></a>

#### Doubled-prime branch failure.

For an odd prime $`p`$, the carry range and $`Z_{2p}=2pZ_{2p-1}+1-b_{2p}`$ give
``` math
\begin{equation}
\label{long68:eq:doubled-prime}
 p^2\mid Z_{2p}
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \begin{cases}
 b_{2p}=1\ \hbox{and}\ p\mid Z_{2p-1},\ \hbox{or}\\
 b_{2p}=1+p\ \hbox{and}\ p\mid2Z_{2p-1}-1 .
 \end{cases}
\end{equation}
```
The historical manuscript cites `Erdos68/PaperCompleteSupplementary.lean`, line 127. This module is absent from the retained source pin; this citation does not establish kernel verification at that pin.

Reduction modulo $`p`$ forces $`b_{2p}\equiv1\pmod p`$, and the two displayed values are the only possibilities in $`[-1,2p-1]`$; division by $`p`$ gives the predecessor conditions. For rational $`S=a/q`$ and $`p>q`$ the tail estimate gives $`Z_{2p}=(2p)!\,S`$, which is divisible by $`p^2`$. Ruling out both branches for infinitely many $`p`$ therefore proves irrationality. The two conditions must be coupled; controlling only the predecessor residue or only the carry does not meet the hypotheses.

<a id="a-remote-cramer-residual."></a>

#### A remote Cramer residual.

Put $`s_n=((n+2)!)^2`$ and $`i_j=(t+j)s_n`$ for $`0\le j\le n+1`$. Form the integer matrix $`A`$ with moment row $`(i_j!)_j`$ and channel rows $`(W_{d,i_j})_j`$ for $`2\le d\le n+2`$, let $`c`$ be the cofactor vector of the moment row, and let $`N_d`$ be the determinant obtained by replacing that row with $`(W_{d,i_j})_j`$. Cofactor expansion gives $`M(c)=\det A`$, $`V_{d}(c)=N_d`$, and $`V_{d}(c)=0`$ for $`2\le d\le n+2`$. By <a href="#long68:eq:channel-congruence" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:channel-congruence">[long68:eq:channel-congruence]</a> each $`(V_{d}(c)-M(c))/(d!-1)`$ is an integer and vanishes for $`d>\max_ji_j`$, so
``` math
\mathcal R_{n,t}:=\sum_{d>n+2}\frac{N_d}{d!-1}
 =\det(A)\,S+K_{n,t},\qquad K_{n,t}\in\mathbb{Z}.
```
Seek a family with $`\min_ji_j=t\,s_n\to\infty`$ and $`\mathcal R_{n,t}\notin\mathbb{Z}`$. Such a family proves irrationality: for a fixed denominator $`q`$, every entry of the moment row is divisible by $`q`$ once the support is sufficiently remote, so $`q\mid\det A`$. Unbounded pairs $`(n,t)`$ do not supply that remoteness, because $`t=0`$ anchors the least support index at zero. The eventual identity $`N_d=\det A`$ controls the tail and gives no control over the finite intermediate block, which changes sign; any gcd-of-minors certificate must specify a positive gcd, its rank hypotheses, and its connection to the displayed residual.

<a id="criteria-from-the-literature-that-do-not-apply."></a>

#### Criteria from the literature that do not apply.

Duverney’s fast-series criteria assume two-sided quadratic denominator growth $`cu_n^2\le u_{n+1}\le c'u_n^2`$, whereas $`u_{n+1}/u_n^2\to0`$ for $`u_n=n!-1`$. His printed Corollary 3.2 displays the signed series $`\sum_n(u_{n+1}/u_n^2-1)`$, without absolute values; its summands tend to $`-1`$ here, so it does not converge to a finite value \[duverney, pp. 275, 285–287\]. The theorem of Barreto, Kang, Kim, Kovač and Zhang proves irrationality of $`\sum_n1/a_n`$ under a rapid-growth hypothesis that fails for $`a_n=n!-1`$, since $`\log(n!-1)=O(n\log n)`$ makes $`(n!-1)^{1/\psi^n}\to1`$ for every fixed $`\psi>1`$ \[barreto-et-al, Thms. 2–3 and Rem. 4\]. Failure of a sufficient criterion is not a theorem about $`S`$, and the useful content is the target these papers identify: a low-height clearing subsequence, or enough exact cancellation in the least common multiple. Theorem <a href="#long68:res:lcm-growth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:lcm-growth">7</a> bounds that cancellation from one side and Theorem <a href="#long68:res:prime-pole" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:prime-pole">2</a> describes it from the other.

Erdős #68 is open. Every rational representation with positive denominator has $`q\ge300000`$.

Attribution. Wilson’s theorem and the Wilson reflection identity are classical, the latter recorded by Stewart \[stewart2004, p. 462, (4)\]. The factorial-digit termination criterion is Cantor’s \[cantor1869\], in the form recorded by Galambos \[galambos1976, Ch. 1\]; the additions here are the telescope $`C=S-e+2`$, the identification of the digit value $`m-2`$, and the transport to the shifted family. The multiplicity bound is Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski’s \[garaev-luca-shparlinski\], and the lcm deduction from it is not theirs. The survival criterion is a specialisation of Louwsma and Martino’s valuation formula \[louwsma-martino, Lemma 4.1\]. For the Wilson cofinality packaging, the finite radius bound and Theorem <a href="#long68:res:lcm-growth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:lcm-growth">7</a>, no antecedent was located, which is a negative search result, and no priority is claimed.

# Extended record

The short note above carries the advertised results with complete proofs. This part keeps the surrounding mathematics: the digit kernel the carry and orbit criteria run on, the exact interfaces of the collision-core reduction, the finite certificates, the superseded deductions, and the routes that were tried and closed.

## The canonical factorial digit kernel

Write $`\theta_0=\{x\}`$ and, for $`m\ge1`$,
``` math
a_m=\lfloor m\,\theta_{m-1}\rfloor,\qquad \theta_m=m\,\theta_{m-1}-a_m ,
```
so that $`\theta_m=\{m!\,x\}`$ for $`m\ge1`$. The kernel checks the floor formula, the digit bounds $`0\le a_m<m`$, the recurrence $`\theta_{m+1}=(m+1)\theta_m-a_{m+1}`$, the finite telescoping expansion
``` math
x=\lfloor x\rfloor+\sum_{m=2}^{N}\frac{a_m}{m!}+\frac{\theta_N}{N!},
```
and the rule that a zero remainder at one index forces every later digit to vanish. The rational direction is also checked: if $`q>0`$ and $`q\le n`$, then $`\operatorname{facFloor}(a/q,n)=((n!/q):\mathbb{Z})\,a`$ and the canonical digit at radix $`n+1`$ vanishes, so every rational input has an eventually zero expansion. The converse holds for every real input, and gives
``` math
x\in\mathbb{Q}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad a_m(x)=0\ \hbox{for all large }m .
```
If all digits after index $`N\ge1`$ vanish, the recurrence gives $`\theta_{N+k}\ge(k+1)\theta_N`$; since every remainder is below one, $`\theta_N=0`$ and $`x=\lfloor N!x\rfloor/N!`$.

A zero canonical digit is a different event from a zero-branch hit. The returned data contain canonical zero digits at $`m=5`$ and $`m=23`$, while the zero-branch list is empty through $`m=100000`$.

A second exact reformulation runs through a defect automaton. For a rational centre recurrence $`F_m=mF_{m-1}+1+\varepsilon_m-C_m`$, the kernel checks that the integer ceiling defect code equals $`\lfloor m\delta_{m-1}-\varepsilon_m\rfloor`$ and that $`\delta_m=m\delta_{m-1}-\varepsilon_m-q_m`$, with the specialisation $`\varepsilon_m=1/(m!-1)`$ written out. What is checked is the algebra of the automaton; proving that the finite-sum residual centre satisfies the premise is a separate step and is not done.

## Criteria from the literature, in full

Koepf and Schmersau prove that eventual equality between the floors of $`n`$ times a partial sum and $`n`$ times its limit forces irrationality \[koepf-schmersau, Thm. 1.1, p. 117\]; their rational-term version obtains that equality from prefix integrality at a scale $`p_n`$ together with the strict tail bound $`a-s_n<1/(np_n)`$ \[koepf-schmersau, Thms. 2.2–2.3, pp. 119–120\]. For the natural termwise clearing choice $`p_n=\operatorname{lcm}\{k!-1:2\le k\le n\}`$ the last two denominators already obstruct it:
``` math
p_n\ \ge\ \frac{(n!-1)\bigl((n-1)!-1\bigr)}{n-1},
```
because $`\gcd(n!-1,(n-1)!-1)=\gcd((n-1)!-1,n-1)\le n-1`$. For $`n\ge4`$ the first omitted summand $`1/((n+1)!-1)`$ then already exceeds $`1/(np_n)`$, so this $`p_n`$ cannot satisfy their tail hypothesis. Cancellation in the reduced prefix denominator could give a smaller scale, and proving enough cancellation is another form of the present denominator problem.

Duverney’s Theorem 3.1 assumes two-sided quadratic denominator growth $`cu_n^2\le u_{n+1}\le c'u_n^2`$, while $`u_{n+1}/u_n^2\to0`$ for $`u_n=n!-1`$ \[duverney, pp. 275, 285–286\]; his printed Corollary 3.2 displays the signed series $`\sum_n(u_{n+1}/u_n^2-1)`$, without absolute values. Its summands tend to $`-1`$ here, so it does not converge to a finite value \[duverney, Cor. 3.2, p. 287\]. The ratio proof divides numerator and denominator by $`(n!)^2`$; the resulting terms tend to zero while $`(1-1/n!)^2`$ tends to one.

The theorem of Barreto, Kang, Kim, Kovač and Zhang proves irrationality of $`\sum_n1/a_n`$ when $`a_n^{1/2^n}\to\infty`$, whereas $`(n!-1)^{1/2^n}\to1`$ \[barreto-et-al, Thms. 2–3, pp. 2–4\]; the limit is kernel-checked through the bound $`0\le\log(n!-1)\le n^2`$. Their proof identifies a useful exact criterion: Mahler’s elementary rationality floor is contradicted by prefix-clearing integers $`D_N`$ whose cleared positive tails satisfy $`\liminf_ND_Nr_N=0`$ \[barreto-et-al, Lem. 8 and Prop. 12, pp. 6, 9–12\]. The ordinary product of the factorial-gap denominators is far too large for that estimate, so a transfer needs a low-height clearing subsequence, or enough exact cancellation in their least common multiple.

Dividing the strict-successor recurrence $`Z_m=mZ_{m-1}+1-b_m`$ by $`m!`$ and telescoping gives the exact finite identity
``` math
\frac{Z_M}{M!}=\frac{Z_2}{2!}+\sum_{m=3}^{M}\frac{1-b_m}{m!},
```
so the carry defects $`1-b_m`$ are genuine factorial-series coefficients. Hančl and Tijdeman give exact rationality classifications for polynomial coefficients and finite-difference criteria for broader ordinary factorial series \[hancl-tijdeman, Thm. 3.1 and Cor. 3.1, pp. 390–391\]; their denominator is the cumulative linear product $`\prod_{n\le N}(an+b)`$, and the individual number $`N!-1`$ does not occur. Applied to the display above, the Cantor–Oppenheim criterion still needs $`1-b_m\ne0`$ infinitely often, which is the missing cofinal assertion.

<a id="long68:sec:ext-superseded"></a>

## A superseded deduction

Before the elementary segment argument of the short note, the record derived a weaker exponent from an external multiplicity theorem. Put $`Q_N=\prod_{2\le n\le N}(n!-1)`$. For an odd prime $`r`$, let $`m_r`$ count the indices $`2\le n\le N`$ with $`r\mid n!-1`$; such an index satisfies $`n<r`$. The factorial-congruence multiplicity estimate of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski \[garaev-luca-shparlinski, arXiv v1, Thm. 12, p. 16\], applied on $`1\le n\le\min(N,r-1)`$, gives $`m_r\ll N^{2/3}`$; the prime $`2`$ divides none of these factors. Writing $`E_r=\max_{2\le n\le N}v_r(n!-1)`$,
``` math
\log Q_N=\sum_r\sum_{n=2}^{N}v_r(n!-1)\log r
 \le\bigl(\max_r m_r\bigr)\sum_rE_r\log r
 \ll N^{2/3}\log L_N ,
```
and Stirling summation gives $`\log Q_N\asymp N^2\log N`$, whence $`\log L_N\gg N^{4/3}\log N`$. Theorem <a href="#long68:res:lcm-growth" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="long68:res:lcm-growth">7</a> supersedes this: its exponent is $`3/2`$, its constant is explicit, and it uses no external theorem. The deduction is retained because it is the shape the returned analyses describe, and because it is the only place a multiplicity bound enters the record.

The primitive lcm divisibility survives cofactor removal: factorial valuations do not remove the channel obstruction once every common cofactor divisor has been removed. A corank-one cofactor and determinant construction for such primitive kernels has not been formalised, and the divisibility theorem does not establish it.

<a id="long68:sec:ext-plateau"></a>

## Plateaux, first exit, and the finite denominator ladder

A second argument works on the rational grid in place of the channels. Let $`H`$ be a partial sum and $`q`$ a candidate denominator. Writing $`qH=k+r`$ and $`q(S-H)=u`$, the next $`q^{-1}`$ grid point $`(k+1)/q`$ lies below $`S`$ exactly when $`1\le r+u`$. The factorial plateau theorem states that if $`H<G\le S`$, if $`n!G`$ is integral, and if $`n!(S-H)<1`$, then the strict successor of $`n!H`$ and the canonical floor of $`n!S`$ are the same grid integer. Two rigidity statements follow: consecutive plateau floors, scaled by the next radix, force the canonical digit to vanish; and any first-exit offset $`\delta\in[0,2)`$ with carry $`b=-\lfloor\delta\rfloor`$ has $`b\in\{0,-1\}`$, so the exit has exactly two alternatives.

The first-crossing argument continues to a denominator bound. For a rational grid level $`G`$ with first crossing $`\tau`$ by the literal partial sums, write $`G-H_{\tau-1}=a/v`$ with $`a,v>0`$. Then $`v\ge\tau!-1`$, and on the $`-1`$ exit branch $`v\ge\tau!(\tau!-1)`$. No coprimality hypothesis on $`a`$ and $`v`$ is needed.

There is also a direct obstruction at prime indices. With $`\Delta_m`$ as in the short note, the kernel checks for $`m\ge3`$ the criterion
``` math
m\mid Z_m
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 1+\frac1{m!-1}<m\Delta_m\le2+\frac1{m!-1},
```
and if $`S=a/q`$ with $`q>0`$, then $`p\mid Z_p`$ for every prime $`p>q`$, so one exact missed prime $`p`$ gives $`q\ge p`$. Exact kernel reduction gives $`11\nmid Z_{11}`$, hence $`q\ge11`$; exact rational normalisation gives $`60\nmid Z_{60}`$, $`64\nmid Z_{64}`$ and $`67\nmid Z_{67}`$, and the prime index $`67`$ gives the checked bound
``` math
S=\frac aq,\ q>0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad q\ge67 .
```
The exact-interval census of the short note replaces $`67`$ by $`300000`$.

There is a finite peeling identity. For $`x\ne0,1`$ and $`K\ge0`$,
``` math
\frac1{x-1}=\sum_{j=1}^{K}\frac1{x^j}+\frac1{x^K(x-1)} .
```
When $`x=k!`$ and a chosen factorial scale is divisible by $`(k!)^K`$, the scaled finite sum is integral and only the last term retains the factor $`k!-1`$ in its denominator. The identity isolates one residual fraction before exact bounding, and it supplies no cofinal family of nonzero residuals.

One proposed strengthening is false and is recorded as false: the divisibility $`(m!-1)\mid\operatorname{den}(V_m)`$ fails at the reported strict events $`m=52`$ and $`m=591`$. Only the Archimedean first-crossing lower bound survives.

There is a second, more arithmetic mechanism at doubled prime indices, stated as <a href="#long68:eq:doubled-prime" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="long68:eq:doubled-prime">[long68:eq:doubled-prime]</a> in the short note. The formal theorem is not restricted to hand-reduced indices; it is the general unique-slot prime-power criterion specialised to the literal prefixes.

<a id="long68:sec:ext-collision"></a>

## The collision-core interfaces

Beyond the definitions used in the short note, the record keeps the exact interfaces of the collision-core reduction.

The collision core has an exact incremental law. For the positive factorial-gap denominators, adjoining $`d_a`$ to a finite family $`S`$ gives
``` math
C(S\cup\{a\})=\operatorname{lcm}\!\Bigl(C(S),\ \gcd\bigl(d_a,\operatorname{lcm}_{j\in S}d_j\bigr)\Bigr),
```
since finite-family gcd and lcm distributivity collapses the lcm of all pairwise gcds against $`d_a`$ to a single gcd. The same formula holds after adjoining the distinguished base, so each step needs only the old denominator lcm and the old core, with no pairwise rescan.

There is an exact product and lcm bound. If $`\widetilde C(S)`$ is the core after cancelling a positive distinguished base, $`L(S)=\operatorname{lcm}_{j\in S}d_j`$ and $`P(S)=\prod_{j\in S}d_j`$, then $`\widetilde C(S)L(S)\mid P(S)`$, hence $`\widetilde C(S)\le P(S)/L(S)`$. For the factorial block this specialises to
``` math
\widetilde C_p\le\frac{\prod_{n\in I_p}(n!-1)}{\operatorname{lcm}_{n\in I_p}(n!-1)},
```
an exact bridge from lower estimates for the factorial-gap lcm to upper estimates for the normalised core. It does not close the local scale bound.

The base cancellation is exact prime by prime. With $`F_p=(p-1)!`$ and $`C_p`$ the unnormalised core,
``` math
\widetilde C_p=\frac{\operatorname{lcm}(F_p,C_p)}{F_p}=\frac{C_p}{\gcd(F_p,C_p)},\qquad
 v_r(\widetilde C_p)=v_r(C_p)-\min\{v_r(F_p),v_r(C_p)\} .
```
So $`r^e\mid\widetilde C_p`$ exactly when the pairwise core carries $`r^{e+v_r(F_p)}`$, which in the block forces two distinct gaps to be divisible by that higher power. The sharp surviving valuation cap $`v_r(\widetilde C_p)+v_r(F_p)<r`$ then gives $`p-1<r(r-1)<r^2`$ for every support prime, and $`\widetilde C_p`$ is coprime to $`k!`$ whenever $`k(k-1)\le p-1`$. This removes every factorial channel below the moving square-root cutoff, and it does not bound the aggregate product of the remaining large prime powers.

For collision estimates that already provide an upper-half hit, no exponent is lost to normalisation: if $`r`$ divides a displayed gap at some $`n\ge p`$, then $`r\nmid F_p`$ and $`r^e\mid\widetilde C_p\iff r^e\mid C_p`$ for every $`e>0`$. This has an exact incidence-count form,
``` math
r^e\mid\widetilde C_p
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 1<\#\{i\in I_p:r^e\mid i!-1\},
```
so a source estimate giving at most one $`r^e`$-hit deletes that exponent and yields $`v_r(\widetilde C_p)<e`$. The local aggregation is exact:
``` math
v_r(\widetilde C_p)=\#\bigl\{e\in[1,r-1]:1<\#\{i\in I_p:r^e\mid i!-1\}\bigr\},
```
and for an endpoint prime with $`2p-1<r`$ the range truncates to $`e\in[1,2p-4]`$. The same equivalence holds under the exact condition $`r\nmid F_p`$ in place of the endpoint inequality, which covers the entire moving prime range at and above the block parameter; at $`e=2`$ it gives a conditional squarefree conclusion $`v_r(\widetilde C_p)\le1`$.

The local load has a distance-sensitive witness. If $`r`$ is prime, $`e>0`$ and $`r^e\mid\widetilde C_p`$, there are $`i<j`$ in $`I_p`$ with $`r^{e+v_r(F_p)}\mid i!-1`$, $`r^{e+v_r(F_p)}\mid j!-1`$ and $`r^{e+v_r(F_p)}\le j^{\,j-i}`$; consequently $`(2p-1)^d<r^{e+v_r(F_p)}`$ forces $`d<j-i`$. The spacing hypothesis is discharged internally: any two $`r^e`$-hits $`i<j`$ satisfy $`e<j-i`$, because $`r\mid j!-1`$ already forces $`j<r`$ and the gap-power inequality converts that size relation into strict separation. The pairwise form is stronger than the selected-witness form: for arbitrary $`r,e`$ and any displayed hits $`i<j`$,
``` math
r^e\mid i!-1,\quad r^e\mid j!-1
 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad r^e\le j^{\,j-i},
```
so every prime-power hit layer is an $`e`$-separated subset of the block and
``` math
(e+1)\,\#\{i\in I_p:r^e\mid i!-1\}\ \le\ 2p+e-2 .
```
The unweighted packing step is therefore complete. Globally,
``` math
r\mid\widetilde C_p
 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
 v_r(\widetilde C_p)+v_r(F_p)<2p-3
```
for every prime $`r`$ and $`p\ge2`$, so even primes already present in the normalisation base pay for their base valuation inside the same block-diameter budget. What remains is to bound the layer counts uniformly as $`r`$ and $`p`$ move, multiply the surviving contributions, and still close the complementary-residue coordinate.

The squarefreeness premise is not proved. An exhaustive modular scan through $`r\le2{,}000{,}000`$ and $`n\le240`$ found four individual square hits and no prime with two such hits. All $`498{,}501`$ pairs $`2\le a<b\le1000`$ have squarefree $`\gcd(a!-1,b!-1)`$, and the aggregate squarefree-collision scan through $`p=499`$ stays below $`0.374`$ of the upper-descending-factorial logarithmic scale. These are finite exact computations. They carry neither theorem authority nor an asymptotic incidence bound.

A finite variant of the cofinal private supply compares the product of a chosen set of primes, each at least $`5`$, with $`\prod_{2\le k\le B}(k!-1)`$; if the prime product is larger, at least one chosen prime has no hit through $`B`$, while Wilson still bounds its least hit by $`q-2`$. Wilson reflection limits what a linear-size divisor can be assumed to be: if $`n`$ is odd, $`n<q`$, and $`q\mid n!-1`$, then $`q\mid(q-n-1)!-1`$, and when both indices lie in one block with the reflected hit earlier, equivalently $`q<2n+1`$, the repeated hit survives predecessor-factorial normalisation and its full-block incidence count exceeds one.

Stewart states that for every $`\varepsilon>0`$ there are infinitely many odd $`n`$ whose least prime factor $`q`$ of $`n!-1`$ satisfies
``` math
n<q<\left(\frac{\sqrt{145}-1}{8}+\varepsilon\right)n ,
```
the printed text transferring estimate (9) from $`n!+1`$ to $`n!-1`$ \[stewart2004, p. 464\]. The source controls $`q`$ relative to the later index $`n`$ and supplies no control relative to the private first-hit index, so it is collision-core input. The missing private-anchor and global product estimates are elsewhere.

One selected prime $`q`$ already furnishes the coprime factor pair $`(1,q)`$: its projection moduli are $`R_p`$ and $`R_p/q`$, whose least common multiple is $`R_p`$, so no second selected prime is needed and there is no hidden equality-or-disagreement branch in that specialisation. The underlying projection rigidity is general: if the endpoint numerator $`Z`$ is congruent to a weighted numerator $`T`$ modulo $`R`$, then every divisor $`Q`$ of $`R`$ with $`Z\le B<Q`$ satisfies $`T\bmod Q=Z`$, so two divisors above $`B`$ with unequal projected residues exclude that bounded endpoint, and unequal projections force $`\min(Q_1,Q_2)\le T`$.

<a id="long68:sec:ext-certificates"></a>

## Finite channel and carry certificates

The finite-support vector $`\lambda=2e_3-e_4`$ has, by kernel check, $`V_{2}(\lambda)=0`$, factorial moment $`-12`$, $`V_{3}(\lambda)=-2`$, $`V_{4}(\lambda)=11`$, and $`V_{d}(\lambda)=-12`$ for every $`d\ge5`$. Under the exact rational tail enclosure $`1/119<\Theta_4<1/50`$ its residual lies strictly between $`-93/575`$ and $`-309/13685`$, so it is nonzero and subunit.

Exact integer regeneration verifies the canonical primitive kernels for every $`2\le D\le12`$: channels $`2`$ through $`D`$ vanish, the factorial moment is $`L_D`$, and the coefficient content is one. At $`D=9`$ the moment is $`L_9=31540008254514077395`$ and, after the stated prime-unit shift, $`1353/100000<R_9<1354/100000`$. At $`D=3`$ the vector $`c=(-40,55,-10,1)`$ on the support $`(3,4,5,6)`$ annihilates channels $`2`$ and $`3`$, has moment $`600`$, and satisfies
``` math
0.09925341997208298<L_3(c)<0.09925341997208300 ,
```
which excludes denominators dividing $`600`$.

There are two different computations at the same endpoint. A returned interval computation reports the stronger geometric statement that no zero-branch event occurs at any $`m\le100000`$; its cited executable and source digest were not supplied, so that classification remains external finite evidence. The strict-successor carry computation used in the short note is local and independently regenerated, with its own source, backend, payload and receipt digests.

<a id="long68:sec:ext-nogo"></a>

## Limits of fixed-coordinate arguments

- Residue vectors, their recurrences, and window widths admit synthetic all-hit blocks, so they cannot prove irrationality on their own.

- Known pointwise prime congruences, prime-dilation congruences, parity, and the exact prime coefficient formula admit a synthetic rational countermodel.

- Wilson quotients, harmonic sums, $`p`$-adic gamma identities, and factorial residues do not control the required Archimedean floor without an additional coupling theorem. Every prime-window test factors into a sharp Archimedean strict-ceiling condition and a modular divisibility condition, and the missing ingredient is the coupling between them.

- Fixed-denominator scalar canonical-product localisers and rank-saturated consecutive-jet Hermite–Padé systems pay the full factorial-gap denominator. For $`E(z)=\prod_{n\ge2}(1-z/n!)`$ the genus-zero product satisfies $`-E'(1)/E(1)=S`$, and the natural scalar linear form carries the coefficient $`Q_N=\prod_{2\le n\le N}(n!-1)`$, for which $`Q_N`$ times the tail diverges. Exact first-order interpolation, scalar residue weighting, the natural Wronskian, and rank-saturated consecutive jets all reassemble the same prohibitive denominator.

- Zero-moment variations cannot create an additional fractional cancellation coordinate, and factorial valuations cannot absorb the channel lcm obstruction.

- A fixed pair of low-index private owners cannot make the projection argument cofinal, by the absorption statement of the short note.

<a id="long68:sec:ext-generic"></a>

## The generic shape behind the lower-interval form

The cofinal statement in the short note has a generic ancestor. For a real $`x`$ and any positive sequence $`c_m`$ with $`c_m<1/m`$ eventually,
``` math
x\notin\mathbb{Q}
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 \{(m-1)!\,x\}\ge c_m\ \hbox{for arbitrarily large }m .
```
For rational $`x`$ the fractional parts vanish eventually; if all large fractional parts lie below $`c_m`$, multiplying by $`m`$ stays below one, so the next canonical digit is zero, and eventual zero digits force rationality. The specific target $`c_m=E_m/m`$ is useful because it translates into finite predecessor-gap conditions. The smallness of the target alone establishes no metric, measure or equidistribution theorem for this orbit, and none is claimed.
