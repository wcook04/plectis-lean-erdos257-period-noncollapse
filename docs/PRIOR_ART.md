# Prior art and attribution map

This is a reading map for the mathematical sources cited in the exposition. It
records relationship, not proof authority: only the pinned Lean source
establishes what this release proves. A citation never widens a release claim,
and a source listed as *context* is not an imported argument or a claim of
mathematical priority. Formalisation/software dependencies are recorded in
[CITATION.cff](../CITATION.cff); the Erdős Problems catalogue supplies
numbering and status context rather than mathematical priority.

The [exposition](../paper/erdos249-257-main-paper.tex) carries the
mathematics bibliography. [CITATION.cff](../CITATION.cff) is intentionally
selected release/software citation metadata: it supplies the recommended
citation for this version and selected foundational or software references,
not a duplicate bibliography. This map explains why the principal sources are
credited.

## Bounded comparison route

Start with
`python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --route trace_prior_art`, then select the
exact local claim with `python3 scripts/query_corpus.py --claim <claim_id>`.
Read its registry status, statement, assumptions, remaining-open links, and
Lean declarations before interpreting any row below. A status such as
`proved here` or `formalised here` is an evidence statement, not a novelty
statement.

For a theorem-level comparison, record the source statement, assumptions,
conclusion, specialisation map, proof mechanism, and residual difference
against that selected local claim. Failure to identify a matching source is
not evidence of novelty. Lean source checked by the pinned Lean kernel remains
proof authority; this bibliography and its search history are authored
attribution evidence only.

## Principal sources

Each entry gives the source, then its relationship to this release, then the
boundary of that relationship.

- P. Erdős and R. L. Graham, [*Old and New Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory* (1980)](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/80_11_number_theory.pdf) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/erdos-graham-1980-source-closure.md)); P. Erdős, [*On the irrationality of certain series: problems and results* (1988)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511897184.009) ([Renyi scan](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1988-22.pdf); [read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/erdos-1988-source-closure.md))

  The 1980 monograph records the full-support divisor Lambert value \(\sum_{n\ge1}d(n)/2^n\) as irrational (printed p. 61), states that the analogous binary totient series could not then be proved irrational (p. 61), and identifies the full-support Mersenne identity \(\sum_{n\ge1}(2^n-1)^{-1}=\sum_{n\ge1}d(n)/2^n\) (p. 62). It also records the squarefree reciprocal question as open (p. 63). Erdős's 1988 article, printed p. 105, explicitly asks whether every increasing support gives an irrational \(\sum_k(2^{n_k}-1)^{-1}\); its density/LCM irrationality theorem is a separate result on pp. 106--108.

  **Boundary.** The 1980 full-support identity and the 1988 p. 105 subseries statement do not prove universal #257; the separate LCM theorem does not automatically apply to Mersenne denominators. The 1980 source explicitly leaves the binary totient irrationality question unresolved, so neither source proves #249, the release's Lean, Comparator, Palomar, geometry, finite-certificate, or totient-kernel claims.

- S. Chowla, [*On Series of the Lambert Type which assume Irrational Values for Rational Values of the Argument* (1947)](https://insa.nic.in/UI/Archivesection.aspx?JID=MA%3D%3D&JYrs=MTk0Nw%3D%3D) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/chowla-1947-source-closure.md))

  Historical conjectural predecessor: its rational-argument Lambert question contains the full-support specialisation \(x=1/b\).

  **Boundary.** Chowla's source is a conjecture in this relation, not the proof source; the theorem formalised here is credited to Erdős (1948).

- P. Erdős, [*On arithmetical properties of Lambert series* (1948)](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1948-04.pdf) ([read source closure](primary-sources/totient-kernel/erdos-1948-lambert-source-closure.md))

  **Full-support divisor row.** Printed p. 63 states irrationality of `f(1/t) = Σ_{r≥1}d(r)/t^r` for every integer `|t|>1`, the Erdős--Borwein divisor-weighted Lambert theorem used for the full-support row.

  **Boundary.** Printed p. 66 explicitly says the analogous Euler-totient series `Σφ(n)/t^n` “seem[s] to present difficulties.” This source therefore does not support irrationality of the #249 totient series, any totient-kernel rank/basis, or the release’s Lean/Comparator claims; no novelty or priority claim is made.

- P. Erdős, [*On the irrationality of certain series* (Math. Student 36, 1968)](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1969-09.pdf) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/erdos-1968-source-closure.md))

  **Pairwise-coprime support theorem.** Printed p. 222 states that if `n_1 < n_2 < ...` are pairwise coprime and `Σ 1/n_i < ∞`, then `Σ_i 1/(t^(n_i)-1)` is irrational for every integer `t ≥ 2`; the proof occupies printed pp. 223–225.

  **Boundary.** Printed p. 222 explicitly states that the pairwise-coprimality condition can be removed, but gives no proof of that extension; printed p. 226 also says the all-primes case is not handled. The source therefore supports attribution of the coprimality-free statement, but it does not supply the omitted argument, solve universal #257, validate the release's Lean/Comparator claims, or support any novelty or priority claim.

- D. Duverney and Y. Tachiya, [*Refinement of the Chowla–Erdős method and linear independence of certain Lambert series* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1515/forum-2018-0299) ([author preprint](https://danielduverney.fr/documents/theorie-des-nombres/DuverneyTachiya190522.pdf); [read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/duverney-tachiya-2019-source-closure.md))

  **Squarefree-support antecedent.** Corollary 1.2 (PDF p. 4; proof pp. 10–11), specialised to `E` equal to the primes, `s=2`, `ell=1`, and `q=2`, proves linear independence of `1` and the squarefree Lambert values at bases `2^j`; Example 1.1 displays the family using `|mu(n)|`.

  **Boundary.** The condition `|q|^L <= s` is essential to this specialisation, so the result does not give squarefree irrationality at every integer base and does not settle universal #257. It also does not prove the release's Lean, Comparator, Palomar, geometry, or totient-kernel claims; no novelty or priority claim is made.

- P. B. Borwein, [*On the irrationality of ∑ 1/(q^n+r)* (1991)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-314X(05)80041-1) ([publisher record](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X05800411); [read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/borwein-1991-qn-r-source-closure.md))

  **Fixed-base rational-offset antecedent.** Theorem 4 (printed pp. 257--258) proves that ∑ 1/(q^n+r) is irrational and not a Liouville number when q is an integer greater than one and r is a nonzero rational avoiding the denominator zeros r = -q^n for n ≥ 1. The paper’s Padé/Stieltjes construction is the direct source for this full-support family.

  **Boundary.** The result is for every positive index with an integer base; it does not settle arbitrary infinite supports, the release's rational noninteger-base claim at `3/2`, universal #257, or the release's Lean results. Its recurrence and Padé estimates are not the Amdeberhan--Zeilberger q-WZ operator, and no novelty or priority claim is made.

- P. B. Borwein, [*On the irrationality of certain series* (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S030500410007081X) ([author PDF](https://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~pborwein/PAPERS/P59.pdf); [read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/borwein-1992-source-closure.md))

  **Full-support antecedent.** Theorems 1 and 2 (printed pp. 142 and 145; proof pp. 142--146) prove irrationality, and non-Liouville behavior, for the full-support series \(\sum_{n\ge1}(q^n+c)^{-1}\) and its alternating variant under their stated integer/rational hypotheses. Theorem 1 with \(q=2\), \(c=-1\) contains the full-support Mersenne--Lambert specialization.

  **Boundary.** The paper sums over every positive index, not an arbitrary infinite support, so it does not settle universal #257, prime-support or squarefree subseries, or the release's #249 reductions. Its contour-integral proof is not formalised here; no novelty or priority claim is made.

- H. Kaneko, Y. Suzuki, and Y. Tachiya, [*Refinements of Erdős's irrationality criterion for certain sparse infinite series* (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20743) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/kaneko-suzuki-tachiya-2026-source-closure.md))

  Nearby current work proving irrationality for sparse series such as \(\sum d(n)^k/t^{\varphi(n)}\).

  **Boundary.** Here \(\varphi(n)\) occurs in the exponent. It does not treat the coefficient-weighted constant \(\sum\varphi(n)/2^n\), its denominator bound, or its tail-certificate equivalence.

- T. M. Apostol, [*Introduction to Analytic Number Theory* (1976)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-5579-4); M. Merca, [*The Lambert series factorization theorem* (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11139-016-9856-3); M. Merca and M. D. Schmidt, [*Generating Special Arithmetic Functions by Lambert Series Factorizations* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.55016/ojs/cdm.v14i1.62425) ([official journal PDF](https://cdm.ucalgary.ca/article/download/62425/53773); [read source closure](primary-sources/totient-kernel/merca-schmidt-2017-lambert-factorizations-source-closure.md))

  Apostol supplies the classical Dirichlet/Möbius background; Merca gives the modern factorisation theorem and Merca--Schmidt its synthesis/unification treatment. Merca--Schmidt's equation (2) records the totient Lambert identity used as transform background, while Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 3.3 give their partition/inverse-matrix mechanism. Apostol/Merca 2017 remain cited background without a source closure in this pass.

  **Boundary.** The release uses classical transforms and claims a Lean-checked composition, not new Möbius inversion, Lambert identities, or the cited factorisation theorems.

- Y. V. Nesterenko, [*Modular functions and transcendence questions* (1996)](https://doi.org/10.1070/SM1996v187n09ABEH000158) ([read source closure](primary-sources/totient-kernel/nesterenko-1996-source-closure.md))

  Direct source for the cited-only transcendence of the divisor-sum ladder rung \(L(\mathrm{Id})=\sum_{m\geq1}\sigma(m)/2^m\).

  **Boundary.** This positions one ladder row only; no part of its modular-transcendence proof is formalised here.

- K. Postelmans and W. Van Assche, [*Irrationality of \(\zeta_q(1)\) and \(\zeta_q(2)\)* (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnt.2006.11.011) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/postelmans-van-assche-2007-source-closure.md))

  Primary source for the cited-only linear independence of \(1,\zeta_q(1),\zeta_q(2)\) when \(q^{-1}\) is an integer of absolute value greater than one. At \(q=1/2\), this implies the irrationality of the squared-ladder value \(L_2(\mathbf1)=\zeta_{1/2}(2)-\zeta_{1/2}(1)\).

  **Boundary.** The release formalises the identity placing \(L_2(\mathbf1)\) in this q-zeta family, not the Hermite--Padé proof. Linear independence of the constant-weight row gives no irrationality transfer to the Möbius row \(L_2(\mu)=S-1/2\), which remains open.

- S. Kakeya, [*On the Set of Partial Sums of an Infinite Series* (1914)](https://doi.org/10.11429/ptmps1907.7.14_250) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/kakeya-1914-source-closure.md))

  Classical strict-tail criterion for subsum sets: domination of every remaining tail by its term gives the Cantor-set regime.

  **Boundary.** The release uses this as historical geometry, not as a claim that Kakeya supplied the local executable machinery.

- V. Kovač and T. Tao, [*On several irrationality problems for Ahmes series* (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10474-025-01528-0) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/kovac-tao-2025-source-closure.md))

  **Fixed-base strict-tail antecedent.** Their Remark 4.1 (PDF p. 13) verifies \(\sum_{\ell>n}(t^\ell-1)^{-1}<(t^n-1)^{-1}\) for every integer \(t\ge2\), and deduces distinct Lambert subsums and a Cantor set. Their Theorem 2.3 (PDF p. 5; proof pp. 13–14) separately constructs rational *merged* sums from several bases under a mass hypothesis.

  **Boundary.** At \(t=2\) the strict-tail remark supplies the known Mersenne geometry, but it does not assert a measure formula. The multi-base theorem allows repeated terms and is not a fixed-base counterexample. The release now formalises compactness, perfection, total disconnectedness, nowhere density, and measure one as well as the two-scale gap, greedy interface, and finite death certificates. It makes no novelty claim for those refinements, and Kovač–Tao explicitly leave the universal fixed-base subseries question open; none of these results settles #257.

- M. Coons, [*(Non)Automaticity of number theoretic functions* (Journal de Théorie des Nombres de Bordeaux 22 (2010), no. 2, 339--352)](https://jtnb.centre-mersenne.org/articles/10.5802/jtnb.718/) ([official PDF](https://jtnb.centre-mersenne.org/item/10.5802/jtnb.718.pdf); [read source closure](primary-sources/totient-kernel/coons-2010-source-closure.md))

  **Global totient-kernel boundary.** Coons's Theorem 3.2, printed p. 349, proves that Euler's totient function is not \(k\)-regular for any \(k\ge2\), using the Dirichlet-series identity \(\sum_{n\ge1}\varphi(n)n^{-s}=\zeta(s-1)/\zeta(s)\). This is the prior-art source for the release's global non-finite-generation context; it does not state the finite-level rank, explicit basis, or relation normal form proved or discussed locally.

  **Boundary.** The release's implication from global non-\(k\)-regularity to infinite-dimensionality of its integer-valued totient-kernel span is a separately authored/formalised bridge. Coons does not prove the release's Lean declarations, dyadic rank \(2^e+1\), CRT--Dirichlet--determinant construction, or Erdős Problem #249. No novelty or priority claim is made for either the cited theorem or the local finite-level results.

- J. Farey, [*On a Curious Property of Vulgar Fractions* (1816)](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786441608628487)

  Historical source for the Farey language. The standard neighbouring-fraction/mediant lemma is the method that directly produces the finite #249 denominator bound: for the committed interval it gives `b+d-1`, exactly the formal bound.

  **Boundary.** The mathematical method and denominator estimate are classical. The local contribution is a kernel-checked arithmetic instance and proof that `b+d` is the first failure for each selected window; the improvement over the classical Farey bound is zero.

- G. Martin, [*Simultaneous inequalities among values of the Euler phi-function* (arXiv:math/0603053, 2006)](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603053) ([read source closure](primary-sources/totient-kernel/martin-2006-source-closure.md))

  **Subsuming source for affine-totient ratio comparisons.** His Theorem 1 assumes only that the slopes \(a_i\) are positive integers and that \(a_ib_j\neq a_jb_i\), and proves that for every \(C>0\) the simultaneous ratio gaps \(\varphi(a_1n+b_1)/\varphi(a_2n+b_2)>C,\ldots\) hold on a set of positive lower density; the symmetry discussion supplies strict ordering patterns. In the local all-base argument this is the external comparison input behind the affine-totient independence statement; the finite dyadic Lean theorem remains separately formalised, not a theorem directly stated by Martin. His Corollary 4 transfers Theorem 1 and Corollaries 2–3 to \(\sigma\).

  **Boundary.** The release's dyadic Lean independence result is separately formalised from this broader comparison input by a finite CRT–Dirichlet–determinant argument; Martin does not present the release's Lean statement or proof. The all-base paper theorem applies Martin directly; Lean checks its zero-residue and composite-base arithmetic layers but does not formalise Martin's positive-density theorem or the final all-base independence step. Martin needs neither odd slopes, nor primitivity, nor a residue bound, and concludes strictly more. A \(\sigma\) analogue would likewise not be new. Exact-title, DOI and venue searches did not locate a separate journal publication, so this is cited as a public preprint.

- F. Luca and Y. Tachiya, [*Irrationality of Lambert series associated with a periodic sequence* (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1142/S1793042113501121) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/luca-tachiya-2014-source-closure.md))

  Direct antecedent for the eventually-periodic coefficient family. Their rational-coefficient theorem contains the indicator-support case and the nonnegative rational weights formalised here.

  **Boundary.** Their theorem is broader, and its Chowla--Erdős/large-modulus-prime proof is separate. This release uses a periodic-divisor certificate route. For signed integer weights it proves only an irrational-or-base-terminating dichotomy; it does not exclude the terminating alternative in general or claim the full mixed-sign theorem.

- T. Tao and J. Teräväinen, [*Quantitative correlations and some problems on prime factors of consecutive integers* (arXiv v2, 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01739v2) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/tao-teravainen-2026-source-closure.md))

  Direct source for the cited-only irrationality of the prime-support series: Theorem 1.3, equation (1.7), on PDF p. 4, with proof on pp. 44--56. It gives the \(\sum_n\omega(n)/2^n = \sum_p(2^p-1)^{-1}\) formulation and this release's separately formalised identity bridge.

  **Boundary.** It settles the prime-support family at base 2, not universal #257. The source only says that other integer bases and the prime-power variant can be treated by modifications and leaves those details to the reader; its quantitative correlation proof is not formalised here.

- H. Wang, [*Sparse Polynomial-Weighted Expansions* (arXiv:2606.24972v4, 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.24972v4) ([read source closure](primary-sources/dyadic-carry/wang-2026-source-closure.md))

  Direct antecedent for the rationality-forced integral carry recurrence in the weighted-binary special case (c(n)=n d_n).

  **Boundary.** The public generic criterion is a formalisation/abstraction; its converse and rigidity make no priority claim. The source's positive-density theorem and Erdős #260 corollary are neither used nor formalised here.

- R. Crandall, [*The googol-th bit of the Erdős--Borwein constant* (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1515/integers-2012-0007); J. M. Campbell, [*On the binary digits of the Erdős--Borwein constant* (arXiv, 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.24160)

  Adjacent work on binary digits of the full-support constant; Campbell resolves Crandall's question on infinitely many occurrences of the block \(11\).

  **Boundary.** Neither result is formalised or used by this release, and neither changes its irrationality or open-problem claims.

## Expansion-note principal sources (#68, #243, #251, #269, #1041, #1049)

The same contract as above applies: relationship, not proof authority, and no
row widens a release claim. Each source below is load-bearing for exactly the
stated use in its problem note, where the full statement-level comparison is
recorded.

Entries carry the same three parts as above — source, relationship, boundary —
grouped by the problem whose note they serve.

### #68

- Koepf–Schmersau, doi:10.1524/anly.2011.1094; D. Duverney (2001), https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/journal/pdf/jms080206.pdf; Barreto–Kang–Kim–Kovač–Zhang (2026); Hančl–Tijdeman

  Four cited irrationality criteria, each checked in the note *not* to apply to `∑ 1/(n!−1)` at a named boundary.

  **Boundary.** Non-applicability results; no criterion is claimed to transfer.

- Garaev–Luca–Shparlinski (Trans. AMS 356), doi:10.1090/S0002-9947-04-03612-8; C. L. Stewart (Publ. Math. Debrecen 65)

  Growth and divisor inputs for the collision-core layer, derived and source-verified in the note.

  **Boundary.** Not kernel-checked; explicitly load-bearing for nothing beyond the stated uses.

### #243

- P. Erdős and E. G. Straus, [*On the irrationality of certain Ahmes series*](https://users.renyi.hu/~p_erdos/1964-19.pdf) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/erdos-straus-1964-source-closure.md))

  Original source for the conditional Ahmes-series rationality criterion cited at Theorem 3, p. 132. Its printed theorem uses the prefix quotient `N_k/n_(k+1)` and the next-index factor `n_(k+1)^2/n_(k+2)-1`; this is the source boundary for the note's correction of the shifted catalogue/survey display.

  **Boundary.** The criterion is conditional and only gives eventual Sylvester recurrence. It does not settle unrestricted #243, the release's Lean results, or any novelty/priority claim.

- D. Duverney, [*Irrationality of Fast Converging Series of Rational Numbers*](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/journal/pdf/jms080206.pdf) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/duverney-2001-source-closure.md))

  Corollary 3.2, p. 287, gives a conditional signed form of the #243 criterion: with `a_n` in `{-1,1}`, rationality of `sum a_n/u_n` is equivalent to the eventual signed recurrence under Duverney's one-sided condition `sum (u_(n+1)/u_n^2-1) < infinity`.

  **Boundary.** The source condition is not written with absolute values; absolute convergence is only a stronger sufficient specialization. The result remains conditional and does not settle unrestricted #243, the release's Lean results, or any novelty/priority claim.

- C. Badea, [*A theorem on irrationality of infinite series and applications*](https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/acta-arithmetica/all/63/4/107785/a-theorem-on-irrationality-of-infinite-series-and-applications) ([publisher PDF](https://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa63/aa6342.pdf); [read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/badea-1993-source-closure.md))

  Adjacent positive-term prior art: Theorem A (p. 313), Theorem 2.10 and Corollary 2.2 (pp. 315–316) force eventual equality in Badea's explicit term-inequality regime, generalizing the positive Sylvester boundary.

  **Boundary.** The hypotheses are positive rational terms plus an eventual inequality; they do not cover unrestricted #243, mixed-sign state orbits, the release's Lean results, or any novelty/priority claim.

- K. Koizumi, [*Irrationality of the reciprocal sum of doubly exponential sequences* (Integers 26 (2026), A28)](https://math.colgate.edu/~integers/aa28/aa28.pdf); [arXiv:2504.05933](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05933) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/koizumi-2026-source-closure.md))

  Supplies normalised vanishing for the canonical orbit, the sole hypothesis of the note's headline conditional theorems not proved in Lean; the published Lemma 3 and Proposition 1(2) (the preprint-v1 Lemma 13 and Proposition 19(2)) are conceded in-note as prior art for the note's absorption and descent lemmas.

  **Boundary.** The bridge is prose; only the integer state-system theorems are kernel-checked here, and no priority or independence is adjudicated.

### #251

- V. Kovač, counterexample to Erdős's variable-denominator expectation (2026, Theorem 1)

  Refutes the 1988 expectation that `∑ p_n/(g_1⋯g_n)` is irrational whenever `g_n ≥ 2`, `g_n = o(p_n)`; the note records that the live catalogue still repeats the refuted expectation.

  **Boundary.** Concerns the variable-denominator variant, not the fixed dyadic series studied here.

- Y. Zhang (2014); J. Maynard (2015), doi:10.4007/annals.2015.181.1.7; Ford–Green–Konyagin–Maynard–Tao (2018), doi:10.1090/jams/876

  Bounded-gap and large-gap prime results, cited and each shown insufficient for the required joint dyadic distribution of a logarithmic block of gap differences.

  **Boundary.** Context; none is used as a proof input.

### #269

- Y. Bugeaud and M. Laurent, Hecke–Mahler transcendence (Theorem 1.1 as cited in the #269 note), doi:10.4064/aa220323-18-1

  External transcendence engine for the note's two-prime theorems: both the de-duplicated and repeated running-lcm reciprocal sums are transcendental for every pair of distinct primes, by a paper argument.

  **Boundary.** The two-prime theorems are deliberately not Lean declarations; nothing follows for three or more primes.

- S. Fan, [comment on Erdős Problem #269](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/269), 26 June 2026

  Earlier public disclosure of the same two-channel factorisation, Hecke–Mahler reduction, and transcendence conclusion; later comments extend it to coprime pairs. This note first appeared on 22 July 2026, 26 days later.

  **Boundary.** No priority claim for the two-prime result. The paper argument was developed independently but is not first and is not a Lean theorem; a broader search would be needed to identify the first public proof.

- P. Erdős, letter of 1 January 1973 (printed p. 335 as cited in the #269 note)

  Asserted the de-duplicated two-prime irrationality without a printed proof; the note's route is an independent modern argument, not a recovery of the unprinted one.

  **Boundary.** Historical formulation and priority context only.

### #1041

- P. Erdős, F. Herzog, and G. Piranian, *Metric properties of polynomials* (J. Analyse Math. 6 (1958), Problem 5, p. 139), doi:10.1007/BF02790232; see the [read source closure](primary-sources/bergman-geodesic/erdos-herzog-piranian-1958-source-closure.md)

  Original problem source, including the known input that one lemniscate component contains at least two zeros.

  **Boundary.** Formulation, not proof; the note's saddle-block diagnosis of a recent manuscript is prose, not Lean.

- Current evidence boundary: the committed [`research_corpus/Erdos1041/FRONTIER.md`](../research_corpus/Erdos1041/FRONTIER.md)
  is the dated route for the current source-only research state, not an
  antecedent source. It records certified strategy refutations, surviving
  carriers, and open gaps that are not part of this historical bibliography.
  Read it before generated `STRONGEST_RESULTS.json`, which can lag the dated
  notes. The corpus is not thereby prior art or a reviewed claim: its rows make
  no peer-review, priority, novelty, or significance assertion, and #1041

- P. Bundschuh and K. Väänänen, *Compositio Math.* 91 (1994), Theorem 2, [official Numdam PDF](https://numdam.org/item/CM_1994__91_2_175_0.pdf) ([read source closure](primary-sources/totient-kernel/bundschuh-vaanenen-1994-source-closure.md))

  External irrationality criterion at base `7/2`; the release checks only its elementary Archimedean height inequality.

  **Boundary.** The analytic argument remains external, and nothing follows at `3/2`.

- T. Amdeberhan and D. Zeilberger, [*$q$-Apéry irrationality proofs by $q$-WZ pairs* (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1006/aama.1997.0565) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/amdeberhan-zeilberger-1998-q-apery-source-closure.md)); W. Van Assche, [*Little $q$-Legendre polynomials and irrationality of certain Lambert series* (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1012930828917) ([read source closure](primary-sources/reciprocal-tail/van-assche-2001-little-q-legendre-source-closure.md)); P. B. Borwein, [*On the irrationality of certain series* (1992)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S030500410007081X)

  Amdeberhan--Zeilberger and Van Assche target the same Lambert value with the same little-$q$-Legendre kernel on different moving diagonals; Van Assche cites Borwein's Lemma 2 for the neighbouring evaluation used in the comparison.

  **Boundary.** The exact nonzero residual in the paper disproves transfer of the Amdeberhan--Zeilberger scalar recurrence to Van Assche's diagonal. No endpoint, lattice, valuation, or denominator gain is transferred merely from the shared kernel. Borwein 1992, not the adjacent 1991 paper, is the cited evaluation source.

## Provisional theorem-specific comparisons

These local rows come after the direct antecedents on purpose. They record
dated searches and residual comparisons; failure to identify a closer theorem
is not a novelty result.

Each entry names the local package, the comparison this release recorded for
it, and the boundary of that comparison.

- **The complete tail-certificate normal form.** The comparison search covered the original problem sources, Erdős's and Borwein's Lambert-series theorems, periodic-coefficient results, and current arithmetic-function series literature. No theorem with the same pointwise certificate equivalence was identified as of 16 July 2026. The finite denominator number is deliberately excluded because it is obtained directly by the classical Farey/mediant method.

  **Boundary.** This is a dated search result, not a priority or novelty theorem. A closer antecedent should replace it if one is found.

- **Finite-difference and affine-moment transport.** General algebraic techniques are applied here to exact Möbius residue kernels and totient-tail windows. The primary-source search found no cited theorem matching the combined curvature, prime-jump, anchored `(3,5)`, or fixed-precision no-go statements.

  **Boundary.** Absence of an identified match is not a novelty claim. The release claims only the pinned Lean theorems and keeps the open supply hypotheses explicit.

- **First-harmonic and large-prime pivot reductions.** The additive-character step and \(\varphi(mp)=\varphi(m)(p-1)\) use standard ingredients; Apostol supplies the arithmetic background. The local statement is the four-term supplier-fibre decomposition, its one-sided \(14/25,1/100,1/100,8/25\) budget, and its composition with certificate completeness.

  **Boundary.** No matching combined theorem is recorded, but no prime-distribution or residual-decorrelation estimate populating the four budgets is proved.

- **Reduced-direction, Stern--Brocot cylinder, and continuant-run package.** The direct sources above supply the classical divisor/Möbius, mediant, and adjacent squared-Lambert settings. The release proves an exact Mersenne-weight probability normalization, a telescoping cylinder law with uniform geometric error, and sharp Fibonacci/continuant run estimates.

  **Boundary.** No priority claim is made. The run estimates have no endpoint consumer, and matching Fibonacci and denominator scales does not prove denominator survival or irrationality of \(S\).

- **Exact \(1/2\)-membership, fatal-gap, and last-producer package.** The strict-tail source above gives the global subsum geometry. The maintained search found no source stating the exact equivalence between \(1/2\)-membership, infinitely many greedy skips, cofinal false seam terminals, and absence of a last skip, nor the surviving middle-producer future-tail condition.

  **Boundary.** This is provisional positioning, not a novelty assertion. Positive membership would refute universal #257; nonmembership would decide only this test value.

## Audit rule for new sources

Add a public citation only when the source can be tied to a named statement,
method, or historical formulation in the release. Before describing a source as
an antecedent of a local theorem family, record the exact statement comparison:
assumptions, conclusion, specialisation map, proof mechanism, and the remaining
delta. Otherwise, retain it as private research context rather than turning a
bibliographic lead into a public priority claim.
